If necessary, use a knife to trim the edges and place the trimmings back on top of the butter and continue to roll into a square. \nTransfer the butter layer to the refrigerator.  \nTo roll out the dough, lightly flour the counter. Place the dough on the counter, and push the rolling pin once vertically into the dough and once horizontally to form four quadrants. \nRoll out each corner and form a 10-inch square. \nPlace the butter layer on top of the dough and fold the sides of the dough over the butter, enclosing it completely. \nRoll the dough with a rolling pin to seal the seams, making sure to lengthen the dough, rather than widening it.  \nTransfer the dough to a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.\nRoll out the dough on a floured surface until it’s 8x24 inches. \nFold the top half down to the middle, and brush off any excess flour.\nFold the bottom half over the top and turn the dough clockwise to the left. This completes the first turn. \nRefrigerate for one hour. \nRoll out the dough again two more times, completing three turns in total and refrigerating for 1 hour in between each turn. If at anytime the dough or butter begins to soften, stop and transfer back to the fridge.  \nAfter the final turn, cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. \nTo form the croissants, cut the dough in half. Place one half in the refrigerator. \nFlour the surface and roll out the dough into a long narrow strip, about 8x40 inches. \nWith a knife, trim the edges of the dough. \nCut the dough into 4 rectangles. \nPlace the chocolate on the edge of the dough and roll tightly enclosing it in the dough. \nPlace the croissants on a baking sheet, seam side down. \nRepeat with the other half of the dough. \nBrush the croissants with the beaten egg. Save the rest of the egg wash in the fridge for later.\nPlace the croissants in a warm place to rise for 1-2 hours. \nPreheat oven to 400°F (200°C).\nOnce the croissants have proofed, brush them with one more layer of egg wash. \nBake for 15 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through. \nEnjoy warm! \n\nInspired by: http://www.finecooking.com/recipe/classic-croissants\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/33442\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network","date":"2017-11-11T20:00:48.000Z"},{"id":"qoGI78-FSko","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/qoGI78-FSko/0.jpg","title":"6 Low-Cost Meal Preps","description":"Reserve the One Top: http://bit.ly/2v0iast\n\nGet the recipes: http://bzfd.it/2m1NwfN\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/36326\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network","date":"2017-11-06T23:00:05.000Z"},{"id":"4_pHKi724VU","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/4_pHKi724VU/0.jpg","title":"Breakfast Potato Volcanoes","description":"Reserve the One Top: http://bit.ly/2v0iast\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/36218\n\n\nMUSIC\nA Brighter Light\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.","date":"2017-11-05T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"YmAWIEEzHn0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/YmAWIEEzHn0/0.jpg","title":"16 Pancakes, Waffles, Crepes, & French Toasts","description":"Reserve the One Top: http://bit.ly/2v0iast\n\nGet the recipes: http://bzfd.it/2lL8DTs\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/36135\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network","date":"2017-11-04T16:00:38.000Z"},{"id":"CFVCloJbrJg","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/CFVCloJbrJg/0.jpg","title":"5 Breakfast Meal Preps For Busy Parents","description":"Reserve the One Top: http://bit.ly/2v0iast\n\nGet the recipes: http://bzfd.it/2iiMnem\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/35518\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network","date":"2017-11-01T01:00:04.000Z"},{"id":"w7KPSp9bXAA","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/w7KPSp9bXAA/0.jpg","title":"Potato-Crusted Quiche","description":"Reserve the One Top: http://bit.ly/2v0iast\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/34627\n\n\nMUSIC\nPenchant_fullmix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.","date":"2017-10-24T14:00:43.000Z"},{"id":"evfRK2j6zpY","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/evfRK2j6zpY/0.jpg","title":"Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes","description":"Check out the Tasty One-Stop Shop for cookbooks, aprons, hats, and more at TastyShop.com: http://bit.ly/2mEBY0e\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nPineapple Upside Down Pancakes With Pineapple Syrup\nServings: 4-5\n\nINGREDIENTS\n2 cups flour\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1½ teaspoons baking soda\n½ teaspoon salt\n¼ cup sugar\n1½ cups milk\n½ teaspoon vanilla extract\n½ cup butter, plus additional for frying\n¼ cup brown sugar\n1½ ounces spiced rum, optional\n1 20-ounce can pineapple rings with juice (we got about ½ cup of juice once separated from the fruit)\nMaraschino cherries\n\nPREPARATION\n1. To a large mixing bowl, add flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Mix until thoroughly combined. Create a small well in the middle of the the dry ingredients. Add milk, half of the reserved pineapple juice, ¼ cup melted butter, and vanilla extract. Whisk until ingredients combine to form a lumpy batter. Set aside while you make the pineapple syrup.\n2. Add the remaining ¼ cup of butter to small sauce pan over medium heat. Once butter is melted, add brown sugar, the remaining pineapple juice, and rum. Bring ingredients to a boil allowing for the sugar to melt and caramelize. Once mixture is smooth and has the consistency of syrup, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Melt a small amount of butter in a frying pan over medium heat and add a slice of pineapple. Cook pineapple ring until lightly caramelized on one side, about 2 minutes, before flipping it.\n4. Once flipped, fill the core of the pineapple with 1-2 maraschino cherries before pouring about ¼ cup of the pancake batter over. Cook until the edges start to set and the top begins to bubble, about 2 minutes, before carefully flipping the pancake--revealing the pineapple underneath. Cook for an additional 90 seconds to 2 minutes until the pancake is cooked through.\n5. Store cooked pancakes in a 200˚F (90˚C) oven until ready to serve.\n6.

It's flaky, delicious, and (best of all) ready to use in the freezer section of your grocery store. Today, I'm using puff pastry as the crust in a rustic apple tart. This dessert really couldn't be easier -- just score a border in your pastry before adding your apples and brushing everything with a quick egg wash before baking. After 35 minutes, this beautifully seasonal dessert is ready to serve (we suggest bringing out some vanilla ice cream, too!).\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \n#COOKINWITHSARAH\nAre you making \"Everyday Food\" recipes at home? Tag them on Instagram with the hashtag #COOKINWITHSARAH for the chance to win an EDF cookbook!\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREP: 20 MINS TOTAL TIME: 1  HOUR\nSERVINGS:6\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 sheet frozen puff pastry (from a standard 17.3-ounce package), thawed\nFlour, for work surface\n3 Granny Smith apples\n1/3 cup sugar\n1 large egg yolk, beaten with 1 teaspoon water, for egg wash\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n2 tablespoons apple jelly, or apricot jam\n\nCOOK'S NOTE\nStore-bought frozen puff pastry sometimes cracks along seams when unfolded. To prevent this, leave pastry folded when you roll it.\n\nDIRECTIONS\nSTEP 1\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees. Open pastry sheet and remove paper. Fold sheet back up. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out pastry sheet (still folded) to an 8-by-14-inch rectangle. Trim edges with a pizza cutter or sharp paring knife. Transfer to a baking sheet; place in freezer. Peel, core, and slice apples 1/4 inch thick. Toss in a large bowl with sugar.\nSTEP 2\nBrush pastry with egg wash, avoiding edges. Use a sharp paring knife to score a 3/4-inch border around pastry (do not cut all the way through). Place apples inside border, and dot with butter. Bake until pastry is golden and apples are tender, 30 to 35 minutes.\nSTEP 3\nIn the microwave or a small saucepan, heat jelly with 1 tablespoon water until melted. Brush apples with glaze. Serve tart warm or at room temperature, cutting into pieces with a serrated knife.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet the Full Recipe: http://full.sc/1d2vNJ6\n\nMore Sweet Treat Recipes: http://full.sc/Q9cvnf\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more?

And the best news of all: This recipe relies on applesauce -- instead of lots of sugar -- to help create a deep fruit flavor, so it's healthier than the average flapjack you'd make from a mix. I can't think of a more fall-friendly (and delicious!) breakfast than this one, so grab your spatula and start cooking.\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nMake your batter better: Mix it the night before you plan on cooking your pancakes and let it rest in your fridge.\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSERVINGS:4\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled)\n1 tablespoon sugar\n1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon fine salt\n1 cup buttermilk\n1/2 cup applesauce\n1 large egg\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted\nCooking spray\n1 apple, peeled and diced small (1 cup)\n\nDIRECTIONS\nSTEP 1\nIn a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together buttermilk, applesauce, egg, and butter. Add applesauce mixture to flour mixture and whisk until just moistened (batter should have some lumps; do not overmix).\nSTEP 2\nLightly coat a large nonstick skillet or griddle with cooking spray and heat over medium-high. In batches, drop batter by 1/4 cupfuls into skillet. Sprinkle each pancake with diced apple. Cook until bubbles appear on top and a few have burst, 2 to 5 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on underside, 2 to 5 minutes. Repeat with more cooking spray and remaining batter, wiping skillet clean between batches.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet the Full Recipe: http://full.sc/1bGLQeZ\n\nMore Breakfast Recipes: http://full.sc/V70546\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more?

It's a savory prosciutto tart that's layered with sweet grape tomatoes and a just-set baked egg. These flaky squares are not only gorgeous to look at but they're dead simple to prepare (store-bought puff pastry makes this recipe a cinch to arrange). You can also easily increase this recipe just by rolling out another pastry sheet. Give your meat-and-potatoes meals a break and try these delicate treats for dinner instead.\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nMake quick work of halving cherry tomatoes by placing them between two plastic lids and slicing them down the center.

I love making breakfast for dinner -- and I think you should, too! Most of my favorite early-morning foods are straightforward recipes that can be prepared quickly. What's not to love? In fact, I enjoy these dishes so much that I'll be cooking up a brand-new breakfast every day this week! Today, I've combined two a.m. classics -- the frittata and strata -- by baking thick cubes of crusty bread inside a mushroom and cheddar frittata. The \"EDF\" test kitchen named this unusual recipe the \"fristrata,\" and I have a feeling you'll love it as much as we do!\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nAvoid using packaged croutons, which are too small and will sink into the frittata, in this recipe.\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREP: 30 mins \nTOTAL TIME: 40 mins\nSERVINGS:4\n\nINGREDIENTS\n10 large eggs, lightly beaten \n1/4 cup whole milk \nCoarse salt and pepper \n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided \n2 slices sourdough bread, cut into 3/4-inch cubes \n1/2 pound button mushrooms, trimmed and sliced \n6 scallions, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated \n1/2 cup shredded cheddar (1 1/2 ounces)\n\nDIRECTIONS\nSTEP 1\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees.
