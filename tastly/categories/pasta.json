It should end up looking like a small volcano. \nGradually add eggs in the volcano’s hole, and carefully incorporate eggs and flour.\nOnce all ingredients have been mixed, knead the dough by pulling, stretching, and folding for about 3-5 minutes, or until it turns elastic and semi-easy to mold. \nMold the dough into a sphere, and wrap it in plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes, or until the dough becomes more relaxed, elastic, and much easier to mold. \nCut the dough in four pieces. Grab the first one, and keep the other wrapped, or cover them with a slightly wet towel to keep them fresh. \nFlatten the first piece, and run it through the widest setting of your pasta maker. Increase the thinness number by one level each time you run the pasta through the machine. \nOnce you can see your fingers through the dough, proceed to cut the fettuccine, or any shape you wish. \nIn a pot with boiling water and salt, cook the pasta for 2 minutes or until it feels tender to the bite. \nServe with your favorite pasta sauce and enjoy!\nRecipe inspired by: http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/homemade-pasta-dough-420521\nAlso inspired by: http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/best-easy-all-purpose-fresh-pasta-dough-recipe-instructions.html\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/40520\n\n\nMUSIC\nTEu\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nDaisychain_Instrumental\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nPrice Is Wrong_FullMix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nHolding Your Nerve_Full\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nLong Way To Go_FullMix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nTour de Force_Full Mix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nWinner_Instrumental (1)\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nGet The Funny Thief_fullmix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nAnother Day_inst\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nAnother Day_fullmix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nOrangenbaum_Fullmix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nFifth Avenue_Undrscr\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nSTILLS\nSmall British kitten and bottle of milk\nOkssi68/Getty Images\nBrit Awards 2013 - Red Carpet Arrivals\nEamonn McCormack/Getty Images","date":"2018-01-14T16:00:12.000Z"},{"id":"JfUJpR1n43U","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/JfUJpR1n43U/0.jpg","title":"Fried Ravioli Sliders","description":"Buy the Tasty Cookbook Today: http://bit.ly/2zVLRyd \n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/41712\n\n\nMUSIC\nLet's Get Crazy_FullNoVox\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.","date":"2017-12-23T23:00:55.000Z"},{"id":"_s5kuGhoedU","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/_s5kuGhoedU/0.jpg","title":"Sweet Potato Gnocchi With Browned Butter And Sage","description":"Buy the Tasty Cookbook Today: http://bit.ly/2zVLRyd \n\nGet the recipe: https://tasty.co/recipe/sweet-potato-gnocchi\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/41992\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network","date":"2017-12-22T23:00:34.000Z"},{"id":"tr7Nn8jI8io","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/tr7Nn8jI8io/0.jpg","title":"$195 Mac 'N' Cheese vs. Homemade","description":"Buy the Tasty Cookbook Today: http://bit.ly/2zVLRyd \n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nhttps://tasty.co/recipe/lobster-mac-cheese\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/39410\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network","date":"2017-12-12T23:00:14.000Z"},{"id":"94RzRT_bIGk","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/94RzRT_bIGk/0.jpg","title":"Ratatouille Lasagna","description":"Buy the Tasty Cookbook Today: http://bit.ly/2zVLRyd \n\nGet the recipe: https://tasty.co/recipe/ratatouille-lasagna\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/39302\n\n\nMUSIC\nIn The Morning_fullmix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.","date":"2017-12-01T02:00:35.000Z"},{"id":"RKPBw7CwQsY","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/RKPBw7CwQsY/0.jpg","title":"Healthier Pasta 4 Ways","description":"FULL RECIPES: http://bzfd.it/2zYJyI5\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/37867\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network","date":"2017-11-23T02:00:29.000Z"},{"id":"KXIOeTCwNBU","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/KXIOeTCwNBU/0.jpg","title":"Pappardelle With Quick Fennel Ragu- Everyday Food with Sarah Carey","description":"Sarah Carey shows you how to make a delicious pasta dish that’s bursting with fall’s best produce.

Make the pasta by adding flour and a pinch of salt to the bowl of a food processor, pulse a few times. \n2. Add the egg yolks, milk, and olive oil.\n3. Run the food processor, adding additional milk or flour if the mixture is too wet or dry. Once it to starts to clump together and becomes a dough, let it get \"worked\" in the food processor for about 10 turns.\n4. Take your pasta to a floured table surface and knead it with your hands until you start to get a shiny, smooth surface.  Wrap in plastic and set it aside to rest, about 30 minutes.\n5. Add all of the truffle shrimp mousse ingredients to a cleaned food processor and run until very smooth.\n6. Transfer to piping bag and set aside in the refrigerator. \n7. Begin rolling out the pasta dough by cutting off about an eighth of the dough ball and flattening with a rolling pin, until it forms a long rectangle about ¼ inch in thickness and is no wider than your pasta machine.\n8. Run the dough strip through your pasta machine from the machine’s widest setting a few times until smooth. Start rolling the dough through the settings, towards the most narrow, skipping no settings in between, rolling the dough through each setting twice. Run the dough through the machine several times at each setting. Cut the dough strip into smaller pieces if it becomes too long and unmanageable. Store finished strips under a damp cloth to keep pasta from drying out.\n9. Use a circular cutter about 3 inches in diameter to cut ravioli. Pipe about 1 tablespoon onto each circle (the amount will vary depending on the exact size of your circles). Egg wash the perimeter and join sides of the circle to form a half circle. Gently pinch dough together to seal ravioli. \n10. Place prepared ravioli on a floured surface to prevent sticking, covered with a lightly moistened towel.\n11. Heat butter for the bread crumbs in a saucepan until milk solids begin to brown and it starts to smell nutty, then remove from heat.\n12. Puree all bread crumb ingredients with the browned butter in food processor until it reaches a coarse sand-like texture. \n13. Return bread crumbs to saucepan and toast until golden. Stir often to prevent burning.\n14. Cook ravioli in salted boiling water 2 minutes. Submerge in ice bath if not serving immediately.\n15. For the glace, melt butter in saucepan. Add chicken stock and whisk together until simmering. Add shallots and chives and then immediately add ravioli. Continuously move the ravioli to warm and coat the with the glace, about 2 minutes.\n16. Serve topped with toasted hazelnut bread crumbs.\n\nMUSIC\nMoment-Joyeux\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/11735","date":"2017-02-20T02:00:26.000Z"},{"id":"j0-eiMHNpT4","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/j0-eiMHNpT4/0.jpg","title":"Spinach-Artichoke Lasagna Roll-Ups","description":"Customize & buy the Tasty Cookbook here: http://bzfd.it/2fpfeu5\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nSpinach-Artichoke Lasagna Roll-Ups\nServings: 4\n\nINGREDIENTS\n12-15 lasagna noodles \n2 cups ricotta\n1 cup spinach\n1 cup artichoke hearts, chopped\n1 tablespoon olive oil \n2 cloves garlic, minced\n2 cups marinara sauce \n1 cup mozzarella, shredded\n1 cup parmesan, shredded\n1 teaspoon salt\n½ teaspoon pepper\nParsley \n\nPREPARATION\n1.

If you freeze this dish, do not thaw before baking. Remove plastic wrap, and cover with foil. Cook until heated through, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours. Remove foil, and continue with step 5.\n\nDIRECTIONS\nSTEP 1\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.

My secret is to use premade wonton wrappers as the \"dough\" for this pasta -- so you don't need measure, mix, roll, or cut! I'm also adding fresh ricotta cheese along with my greens, which gives each bite a creamy finish. Stuffing and sealing the ravioli is a great kid-friendly step, so invite your little one into the kitchen to help. Who knows? You might discover a new chef in your family!\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nWonton wrappers, used in this recipe to make ravioli, are typically stored in the dairy section of most grocery stores, near the tofu and other chilled vegetarian items.\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREP: 30 MINS TOTAL TIME: 45 MINS\nSERVINGS:8\n\nINGREDIENTS\nCoarse salt and ground pepper\n1 bunch kale (3/4 pound), tough stems and ribs removed\n1 3/4 cups ricotta\n1/3 cup grated Parmesan\n1 garlic clove, minced\n48 square wonton wrappers (from a 12-ounce package)\n4 cups marinara sauce, warmed\n\nDIRECTIONS\nSTEP 1\nIn a large pot of boiling salted water, cook kale until tender, 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer kale to a colander. When cool enough to handle, squeeze out excess water and finely chop. In a medium bowl, mash together kale, ricotta, Parmesan, and garlic; season with salt and pepper.\nSTEP 2\nAssemble ravioli: Arrange 6 wrappers on a work surface, keeping remaining wrappers covered with a damp towel. Spoon a scant tablespoon kale mixture in center of each wrapper. With a fingertip, moisten edges of wrapper with water, then fold over filling to form a triangle and press to seal (flatten area around filling to eliminate air pockets). Place ravioli on a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with a kitchen towel. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.\nSTEP 3\nReturn salted water to a boil; reduce to a bare simmer. Drop half the ravioli into water, one at a time, stirring gently to prevent sticking. Cook until al dente, about 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer ravioli to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet, arrange in a single layer, and let drain briefly. Repeat with remaining ravioli. Serve topped with sauce.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet the Full Recipe: http://full.sc/1cERpLt\n\nMore Pasta Recipes: http://full.sc/PeV7er\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more?

So I decided to share it with you for Mother's Day.\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nFor this recipe, you'll need tomato sauce, uncooked manicotti shells, and filling made from ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, garlic, eggs, parsley, and a bit of sugar. Pipe it into the uncooked shells. That part can be messy, but it's fun when you get the hang of it. Bake with plenty of sauce until bubbly, and give it a sprinkle of extra Parm near the end.

But it's so easy to make at home (and easy on the wallet, too).\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nThe cutlets cook in the time it takes to boil pasta. So once you get your linguine into boiling water, coat chicken or veal cutlets in flour and saute them in olive oil. Then make a simple pan sauce with white wine, lemon juice, butter, and capers.

Place flour in a shallow bowl. Season cutlets with salt and pepper, then dip into flour, turning to coat; shake off excess.\n\nIn a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high. Add half the chicken; cook until lightly browned and opaque throughout, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate; cover with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining tablespoon oil and chicken (reserve skillet for sauce).\n\nMeanwhile, cook linguine in boiling water until al dente, according to package instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water. Add spinach, and stir until submerged. Drain pasta mixture and return to pot. Toss with 1 tablespoon butter; season generously with salt and pepper. Add some reserved pasta water if necessary. Cover to keep warm.\n\nInto skillet, pour wine and lemon juice. Cook over medium-high, stirring to loosen browned bits, until liquid has reduced to 1/3 cup, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat; swirl in 2 remaining tablespoons butter until melted. (For a smoother sauce, strain through a fine-mesh sieve, if desired.) Add capers, and season with salt and pepper. Divide chicken and linguine among four serving plates; top chicken with sauce.\n\nCook's Note:\nCapers are often packed in brine.

How do I know? Because you asked for it! Yep, it's Reader Request Week here at Everyday Food: You wrote in on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, and now I'm whipping up the dishes you wanted to see me make. Plenty of you asked for lightened-up comfort-food recipes and foods with \"hidden\" veggies that even picky eaters would like. This mac and cheese fits the bill!\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nThe base is pasta mixed with broccoli florets (there's your hidden veggie) and the sauce is made from olive oil, onion, ground mustard, flour, and a lighter cheese trifecta: Neufchatel, which is naturally low in fat, plus extra-sharp cheddar and grated Parmesan, which are so flavorful you don't need to use that much. Some low-fat milk makes it creamy, while toasted panko breadcrumbs give the casserole a nice crunchy topping.

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta 3 minutes less than package instructions. Add broccoli and cook 3 minutes more. Drain.\n\nMeanwhile, heat oil in a large pan over medium-high. Add onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and ground mustard. Saute until onion is translucent, about 4 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add Neufchatel, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring until incorporated. Gradually whisk in milk, then bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in cheddar and Parmesan, then add pasta and broccoli. Season with salt and pepper.\n\nTransfer to an 8-inch square baking dish and bake until bubbling in center, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle with panko, and serve.\n\nCook's Note\n\nRecipe Makeover!\nA serving of mac and cheese can pack up to 800 calories and 40 grams of fat. We whittled those numbers way down by subbing 1% milk for whole and creamy Neufchatel for higher-fat cheeses. Broccoli adds substance and vitamins.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet the Full Recipe: http://www.marthastewart.com/969073/lighter-three-cheese-mac\n\nNutritional Info: per serv (makes 6): 453 cal; 20 g fat; 21 g protein; 45 g carb; 2 g fiber\n\nMore Pasta Recipes: http://full.sc/PeV7er \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more?

So throughout the week, I will let you in on my favorite ways to keep costs down without sacrificing summer fun.\n\nLet's start with this fresh potluck idea: Mexican-Style Lasagna! It's an irresistible cross between enchiladas and lasagna -- both dependable crowd favorites -- plus it's meatless, so the vegetarians in the group can dig in. It's also fantastic for dinner (or breakfast!) any day of the week. I use hearty corn tortillas instead of noodles, then layer them with protein-rich pinto beans (they're lighter and cheaper than meat) and a fresh mixture of baby spinach, cilantro, and scallions. I top it all off with some salsa and shredded pepper Jack cheese to get my new, signature, any-occasion meal.\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day:\nWatch the video and I'll show you how to get your cheese perfectly melted and brown.
