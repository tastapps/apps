Stir to combine.\nHeat a bit of oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. \nSeason the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. When the oil is shimmering, sear the salmon on one side until golden brown. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown and the fish is cooked through. Remove the salmon from the heat and wipe out the skillet.\nCut the squash, zucchini, carrots, and watermelon radishes in half, if needed, then spiralize.\nHeat a bit of oil in the pan over medium heat until simmering. \nAdd the vegetable noodles to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Saute until tender, about 2 minutes. \nDivide the vegetable noodles between two plates. \nPlace a piece of salmon on each bed of noodles, then top with tomato sauce.\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nWolfgang Puck's Trout in Puff Pastry\nServings: 6\n\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n½ cup celery, sliced \n½ cup leeks, julienned\n½ cup carrots, julienned\nSalt, to taste\nWhite pepper, to taste\n1 cup heavy cream\n1 whole trout, cleaned\nBlack pepper, to taste\n2 tablespoons fresh tarragon, chopped\n2 sheets puff pastry\n2 eggs, beaten\nParsley, for serving\nLemon wedges, for serving\n\nChive Butter Sauce:\n1 cup white wine\nJuice of one lemon\n4 shallots, minced\n½ bunch tarragon \n1 cup heavy cream\n18 tablespoons (2 ¼ sticks) butter, sliced\nSalt, to taste\nPepper, to taste\n2 bunches chives, minced\n \nPREPARATION\nHeat the olive oil in a medium pan over medium heat. \nAdd the celery, leeks, carrots, and a pinch of salt and white pepper, and sauté until the vegetables start to cook down. \nAdd the cream and stir to coat the vegetables. Cook until the cream is thickened.\nRemove the pan from the heat.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out both sheets of puff pastry until they are ⅓-inch thick. Transfer one sheet of puff pastry to the baking sheet.\nCut the trout along the back to remove the spine, then butterfly open. Season with salt, pepper, and the tarragon. \nScoop the cooked vegetables onto one side of the fish, then fold over the other fillet. \nTransfer the fish to the center of the sheet of puff pastry. \nBrush egg wash around the fish, then lay on the second sheet of puff pastry, pressing around the fish to seal. Use a paring knife to cut away the excess puff pastry in the shape of a fish. \nBrush the top of the puff pastry with egg wash and use the leftover pastry scraps to decorate the fish with an eye and gills. Use the tip of the knife or the large opening of a pastry tip to draw scales on the body and tail. \nChill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.\nMake the Chive Butter Sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the wine, lemon juice, shallots, and tarragon. Reduce until only a ¼ cup of liquid remains. Add the cream and reduce until the mixture thickens slightly.\nSlowly whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time, until the sauce is glossy and thickened. \nRemove the tarragon stem and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the chives.\nPreheat the oven to 375℉ (190℃). When the oven is heated. Bake the fish for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.\nTransfer the fish to a platter and garnish with fresh parsley and lemon wedges.\nTo serve, cut the fish into indiv","date":"2018-03-03T02:00:14.000Z"},{"id":"IwkHyDZynF0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/IwkHyDZynF0/0.jpg","title":"7 Recipes For Seafood Lovers","description":"Reserve the One Top: http://bit.ly/2v0iast\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/49400\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network","date":"2018-03-02T23:00:08.000Z"},{"id":"4qnna_CvmH0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/4qnna_CvmH0/0.jpg","title":"Trinidadian Roti","description":"Get the recipe: https://tasty.co/compilation/trinidadian-roti\n\nReserve the One Top: http://bit.ly/2v0iast\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/49530\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network","date":"2018-03-01T20:00:33.000Z"},{"id":"uAoUxQMP4Ik","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/uAoUxQMP4Ik/0.jpg","title":"Uncle Pooh's Shrimp, Sausage, And Grits","description":"Buy the Tasty Cookbook Today: http://bit.ly/2zVLRyd \n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/49552\n\n\nMUSIC\nForever Until The End_FullNoVox\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.","date":"2018-03-01T02:00:04.000Z"},{"id":"K5dbRwf8PlI","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/K5dbRwf8PlI/0.jpg","title":"What Would They Eat In \"Black Panther\"?","description":"Have you ever wondered what type of food they would eat in Wakanda?

Restaurant Pizza","description":"Reserve the One Top: http://bit.ly/2v0iast\n\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nUltimate Homemade Pizza\nMakes 6 pies\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\nDough\n7 cups flour\n4 tablespoons Kosher salt\n½ teaspoon dry active yeast\n4 cups water, at room temperature\nSemolina or cornmeal, for the pizza peel\nExtra flour, for shaping\n\nSauce\n6 ounces tomato paste\n1 cup hot water\n2 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n2 teaspoons maple syrup or honey\n1 teaspoon salt \n½ teaspoon pepper\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n½ teaspoon dried oregano\n½ teaspoon dried basil\n½ teaspoon dried marjoram\n¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper\n\nPREPARATION\nIn a very large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients.\nMake a divot in the middle of the flour mixture and add a few tablespoons of water. Stir with a wooden spoon, gradually adding more and more water until the dough starts to come together. You may need a tablespoon more or less water, depending on the consistency of the dough as it forms. \nUsing your hands, ensure the dough is well incorporated, but do not knead. Be careful not to overwork the dough.\nCover with plastic wrap and store at room temperature overnight, or for at least 12 hours,  until doubled in size and porous. \nMake the sauce by combining tomato paste, water, vinegar, maple syrup, salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, basil, marjoram, and cayenne pepper in a medium bowl. Let sit at room temperature for an hour before canning or jarring. Refrigerate as necessary up to 2 weeks. \nOnce the dough has risen, transfer to a clean, floured work surface and form into a large ball. Cut the dough into 6 equal parts and form dough balls by folding the corners into themselves. \nPlace the dough balls on a floured sheet pan, sprinkle with flour, and cover with a damp towel for about 30 minutes to an hour. \nPreheat oven with a pizza stone in it to 500ªF (260ºC) or a low broil. \nWork each dough into a disk on a floured work surface. Knuckling the edges of the dough and tossing it gently will help thin it out. Be careful not to rip the dough.\nPlace the dough disk onto a pizza peel generously floured with semolina or cornmeal. This will prevent sticking. Top with desired sauce, cheese, and toppings. \nSlide the pizza onto the stone and bake for about 9 minutes, watching carefully to make sure it doesn’t burn. Look for the edges to become charred and crispy and the cheese to bubble. \nLet the pizza cool for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving. \n\nInspired by Jim Leahy: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/no-knead-pizza-dough\n\nInspired by Epicurious: \nhttps://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/pizza-sauce-50188555\n\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/38260\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network\nSFX Provided By AudioBlocks\n(https://www.audioblocks.com)\n\nSTILLS\nEmoji provided free by http://emojione.com","date":"2018-02-01T17:00:26.000Z"},{"id":"TYZh-LQ6FPU","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/TYZh-LQ6FPU/0.jpg","title":"Homemade Sushi Dinner for 2","description":"Get the recipes: https://tasty.co/compilation/american-style-sushi-dinner-for-2\n\nReserve the One Top: http://bit.ly/2v0iast\n\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/37201\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network","date":"2018-01-30T17:00:18.000Z"},{"id":"3X5pJ6R1AZY","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/3X5pJ6R1AZY/0.jpg","title":"Eggplant Dinners 4 Ways","description":"Reserve the One Top: http://bit.ly/2v0iast\n\n\nGet the recipes: https://tasty.co/compilation/eggplant-dinners-4-ways\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/44063\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network","date":"2018-01-30T02:00:22.000Z"},{"id":"oOe_g1IX5g8","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/oOe_g1IX5g8/0.jpg","title":"Bacon-Cheddar–Loaded Cheeseburger","description":"Buy the Tasty Cookbook Today: http://bit.ly/2zVLRyd \n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/34429\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network","date":"2018-01-29T20:00:46.000Z"},{"id":"ns3uzx8lsNw","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/ns3uzx8lsNw/0.jpg","title":"Chicken Spinach Feta Pie","description":"Reserve the One Top: http://bit.ly/2v0iast\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/45638\n\n\nMUSIC\nWhat's Up_fullmix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.","date":"2018-01-29T17:00:42.000Z"},{"id":"dOy9mohYW80","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/dOy9mohYW80/0.jpg","title":"5 Delicious Pork Recipes","description":"Buy the Tasty Cookbook Today: http://bit.ly/2zVLRyd \n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nhttps://tasty.co/recipe/slow-cooker-carnitas\n\nhttps://tasty.co/recipe/slow-roasted-honey-glazed-pork\n\nhttps://tasty.co/recipe/bbq-pulled-pork-fries\n\nhttps://tasty.co/recipe/garlic-herb-stuffed-pork-chops\n\nhttps://tasty.co/recipe/sweet-sour-pork\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/45546\n\n\nMUSIC\nThe 5 A.m.

Erik recommends rendering beef suet in a hot skillet with garlic and thyme to cook the burgers in (as an alternative to oil).  \n\nThe Sauce \n½ cup mayonnaise \n2.5 tablespoons ketchup\n2.5 tablespoons pickle relish\n1 teaspoon white wine vinegar\n1 teaspoon lemon juice\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nGarnish\nPotato rolls, lightly toasted\nIceberg lettuce, shredded\nTomatoes, thinly sliced\nOnion, thinly sliced\nAmerican cheese\nDill pickle chips\n\nPREPARATION\n1. In a medium bowl, combine cubed chuck roll, salt, black pepper, thyme, and sliced garlic. Stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate to cure overnight. \n2. Prepare the sauce: in a small mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Whisk together. Refrigerate to bring flavors together. \n3. Using a stand mixer fitted with meat grinder attachment, grind the cured meat, layering in pieces of chopped bacon throughout. (Ensure the meat and grinder attachments are very cold before grinding! Recommended that you place it in the freezer for a few minutes just before using.)\n4. Lightly mix together the ground meat and then form into six, 3 ounce balls. \n5. To a hot, oiled, cast iron skillet, over medium/high heat - add the balls and allow to cook slightly. Using two spatulas layered on top of one another, press down on the burger to form into thin patties. Continue to cook until the underside has browned and caramelized. \n6. Flip the burgers and continue to cook until the second side just begins to brown. Top with cheese and remove from the skillet. \n7. To assemble: Spread the burger sauce onto both halves of a toasted potato bun. On the bottom bun, layer lettuce, tomato, and a sprinkle of salt. Add one burger patty, thinly sliced onions, then the second burger patty. Place 4 pickles onto the top bun and place on top of the burger. Enjoy!\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 rasher bacon\n1 sausage\n100g slice halloumi\n100g fried onions\n25g pickles\nKetchup and mustard\n\nPREPARATION\n1. Light the BBQ\n2. Cut the bacon, halloumi and sausage into 6 and divide between the two skewers.\n3. Grill on the BBQ until slightly charred.\n4. Serve in a hot dog bun, topped with fried onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard\n5.

Heat the oven to 425º F (220ºC). Butter a 9-inch springform pan and tightly wrap the outside bottom edges with aluminum foil to seal and prevent leakage while baking.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, add oil, garlic, and onion, and cook for 1 minute. Add the broccoli and water and cook until the broccoli tenderizes, about 3 minutes. \nAdd the sausage and cook through. Stir in the tomato paste and add the whole tomatoes. Use tongs to roughly crush them in the pan and add salt to taste (about 1 teaspoon should be fine). \nSimmer, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from heat and set aside.\nAdd salt to the boiling water and cook the spaghetti until very al dente, about 7 minutes. Drain the pasta, but do not rinse it, and reserve the pot.\nIn the pasta pot, whisk the milk, eggs, pepper, and about 1 teaspoon of salt. Stir in the cheddar, fontina, and 1 cup of the Parmesan cheese. \nAdd the sausage mixture, stir, and then carefully fold in the cooked spaghetti. \nTransfer to the buttered springform pan and tightly pack the spaghetti so that the filling is flush with the top edge of the vessel. Set the pan on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.\nBake for 35 minutes until the edges are golden and bubbling. \nRemove the pan from the oven. Turn on the broiler. Sprinkle the top of the pie with remaining Parmesan and sage. Broil until the top is golden. Let the pie rest about 10 minutes before disengaging the springform. \nEnjoy!\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/30764\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network\n\n\nEXTERNAL CREDITS\nGail Simmons\nhttp://gailsimmons.com/","date":"2017-10-27T16:00:54.000Z"},{"id":"6XQo6RNpEdI","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/6XQo6RNpEdI/0.jpg","title":"6 Delicious Potato Recipes","description":"Download the new Tasty app: http://tstyapp.com/m/mFqUXJtD3E\n\nReserve the One Top: http://bit.ly/2v0iast\n\nGet the recipes: http://bzfd.it/2gGlhgX\n\nCheck us out on Facebook!

Once it to starts to clump together and becomes a dough, let it get \"worked\" in the food processor for about 10 turns.\n4. Take your pasta to a floured table surface and knead it with your hands until you start to get a shiny, smooth surface.  Wrap in plastic and set it aside to rest, about 30 minutes.\n5. Add all of the truffle shrimp mousse ingredients to a cleaned food processor and run until very smooth.\n6. Transfer to piping bag and set aside in the refrigerator. \n7. Begin rolling out the pasta dough by cutting off about an eighth of the dough ball and flattening with a rolling pin, until it forms a long rectangle about ¼ inch in thickness and is no wider than your pasta machine.\n8. Run the dough strip through your pasta machine from the machine’s widest setting a few times until smooth. Start rolling the dough through the settings, towards the most narrow, skipping no settings in between, rolling the dough through each setting twice. Run the dough through the machine several times at each setting. Cut the dough strip into smaller pieces if it becomes too long and unmanageable. Store finished strips under a damp cloth to keep pasta from drying out.\n9. Use a circular cutter about 3 inches in diameter to cut ravioli. Pipe about 1 tablespoon onto each circle (the amount will vary depending on the exact size of your circles). Egg wash the perimeter and join sides of the circle to form a half circle. Gently pinch dough together to seal ravioli. \n10. Place prepared ravioli on a floured surface to prevent sticking, covered with a lightly moistened towel.\n11. Heat butter for the bread crumbs in a saucepan until milk solids begin to brown and it starts to smell nutty, then remove from heat.\n12. Puree all bread crumb ingredients with the browned butter in food processor until it reaches a coarse sand-like texture. \n13. Return bread crumbs to saucepan and toast until golden. Stir often to prevent burning.\n14. Cook ravioli in salted boiling water 2 minutes. Submerge in ice bath if not serving immediately.\n15. For the glace, melt butter in saucepan. Add chicken stock and whisk together until simmering. Add shallots and chives and then immediately add ravioli. Continuously move the ravioli to warm and coat the with the glace, about 2 minutes.\n16. Serve topped with toasted hazelnut bread crumbs.\n\nMUSIC\nMoment-Joyeux\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/11735","date":"2017-02-20T02:00:26.000Z"},{"id":"DPIiE9wBSp0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/DPIiE9wBSp0/0.jpg","title":"One-Pan Honey Garlic Chicken","description":"Customize & buy the Tasty Cookbook here: http://bzfd.it/2fpfeu5\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nONE-PAN HONEY GARLIC CHICKEN\nServings: 4-6\n\nINGREDIENTS\n6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs\nSalt, to taste\nPepper, to taste\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n3 garlic cloves\n1 tablespoon brown sugar\n¼ cup honey\n1 teaspoon dried thyme\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n1 pound green beans\n\nPREPARATION\n1.

Do not cut through the end of the tail.\nUsing a spoon, separate the meat from the two sides of the shell, then lift the meat up and out from inside the shell. Press the two sides of the shell together, then lay the meat over the seam where the two shells meet. If you are having difficulty opening the shell up to lift out the meat, flip the tail over and make cuts along the carapace where the legs meet the bottom part tail. This will help break the rigid structure of the shell and allow it to be more flexible.\nWhile cutting through the shell, you may have also cut into the meat, which is perfectly okay. Make a shallow cut through the middle of the lobster meat so that you can peel down the thin layer of meat over the sides. This gives the lobster tail its signature look. \nIn a small bowl, combine the butter, salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, lemon juice, and parsley, then brush the mixture evenly over the lobster meat.\nPlace the tails onto a baking sheet, then bake for approximately 12-15 minutes, until the lobster is fully cooked but not rubbery.\nServe with a side of broccoli and a lemon wedge!\n\n\nMolten Lava Brownie\nServings: 2\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 box brownie mix, prepared according to package instructions\nCooking spray\n4 chocolate truffles\nMixed berries, to serve\nMint, to garnish\nIce cream, to serve\nChocolate sauce, to serve (optional)\n\nPREPARATION\nIn a large bowl, prepare the brownie mix.\nSpray 2 6-to-8-ounce ramekins with the cooking spray.\nPlace a spoonful of the brownie batter into each ramekin, then place two chocolate truffles in each dish.\nSpoon more brownie batter over the top of the truffles, until the ramekin is about ¾-full. Smooth the batter evenly over the truffles.\nBake for 25 minutes, then cool for another 25 minutes.\nOn the serving plate, place the berries and the mint in a corner.\nTo ensure that the brownie comes loose, run a knife around the edges of each ramekin before inverting the dish onto the center of each plate.\nServe with ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce\n\n\n\nEditor’s note: In order to have everything cooked and served at the perfect time, start by preparing the garlic bread up until the point where the mixture is spread onto both sides of the baguette. Set aside. Then prepare the lobster accordingly, and the moment the lobster comes out of the oven, bake the garlic bread accordingly so that by the time the lobster is cool enough to eat, the garlic bread is still hot and bubbly. The brownie can be baked when the garlic bread comes out, so while champagne is being poured and the two of you are eating, the brownie can finish cooking/cooling. This way, the brownie is still warm when served, providing a nice contrast to the ice cream.\n\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nMUSIC\nSunshine And Champagne\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.co","date":"2017-01-31T22:00:53.000Z"},{"id":"YklBmGx5li0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/YklBmGx5li0/0.jpg","title":"Paprika Chicken & Rice Bake","description":"Customize & buy the Tasty Cookbook here: http://bzfd.it/2fpfeu5\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nPaprika Chicken & Rice\nServings: 5\n\nINGREDIENTS\n5 chicken thighs\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon pepper\n1 teaspoon paprika\n1 teaspoon dried parsley\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 tablespoon garlic, minced\n½ cup red onion, diced\n1 cup long grain rice\n1½ cups chicken broth\nSalt, to taste\nPepper, to taste\n\nPREPARATION\n1.

After about 7-10 minutes the mushroom mixture should shrink to half the original volume and begin to form a paste. At this point, remove the mushroom mixture from the heat and set it aside. (NOTE: The goal here is to cook off the bulk of the water inside the mushrooms. This’ll keep the puff pastry from being too mushy at the end.)\nPreheat oven to 400˚F/200˚C.\nLiberally season the outside of the tenderloin pieces with salt and pepper. In another medium-sized frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of neutral oil over high heat. Once the oil has begun to smoke, quickly sear the tenderloin pieces on both sides (45-60 seconds per-side). Once seared, transfer the meat to a plate or cutting board to rest. \nUsing a basting brush, generously paint the mustard over the resting pieces of beef, making sure to coat both sides. \nTo assemble the Wellingtons, lay out a piece of puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Place a piece of ham in the center of the pasty. Next, layer about 1 tablespoon of the mushroom mixture on the center of the ham using the back of a spoon to flatten the paste to about the size of the tenderloin pieces. Place one of the mustard-coated beef fillet on top of the mushroom mixture, then top the piece of beef with another spoonful of the mushroom mixture, making sure to pat it down flat across the top of the meat. Layer with another piece of ham and close the the Wellington by folding the puff pastry over the center of the meat. Using your hands, carefully seal the edges of the pastry then transfer SEAM-SIDE DOWN to a baking tray lined with parchment paper. \nLightly brush the outside of each Wellington with egg wash. Using the back of a paring knife, lightly score the tops of the pasty in a checkered pattern, being careful not to pierce the pastry. \nBake the Wellingtons in a 400˚F/200˚C oven until the pastry is fully cooked and golden brown (about 20 minutes).\nAllow each Wellington to rest at least 10 minutes before cutting into it. \nEnjoy!  \n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nMUSIC\nCaring Christmas\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nMade by BFMP www.buzzfeed.com/videoteam.","date":"2016-12-30T20:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"-L5AbWf25Bs","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/-L5AbWf25Bs/0.jpg","title":"Maple-Glazed Salmon Dinner in 15 Minutes or Less","description":"Customize & buy the Tasty Cookbook here: http://bzfd.it/2fpfeu5\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nMaple-Glazed Salmon Dinner in 15 Minutes or Less\nServings: 2\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\nSalmon\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n¼ cup maple syrup\n2 tablespoons orange juice\n2 tablespoons soy sauce\n1 teaspoon ground ginger\n1 garlic clove, minced\nPepper, to taste\nSalt, to taste\n2 4-ounce salmon fillets \nFresh parsley, for garnish \n\nBroccoli\nDash of salt\n1 pound broccoli florets \n2 tablespoons butter\n1 tablespoon soy sauce \n1 garlic clove, minced\n1 teaspoon lemon zest\n1 teaspoon red pepper flakes \n\n\nPREPARATION\nFor the salmon, heat vegetable oil on medium-high in a cast-iron skillet. \nFor the broccoli, fill a medium pot halfway with water.

Add flour and whisk to ensure there are no lumps before adding the chicken stock. Cook out this mixture for 5-10 minutes while continuously stirring.

Season with the salt, pepper, and cayenne (if using). Taste the sauce and see if your sauce needs more seasoning. Add the cream now and stir to combine.

Transfer the filling into a clean bowl and chill in the fridge for 1 hour, or until cool. \n\nPreheat the oven to 400˚F / 200 ˚C. \n\nRoll out the puff pastry, using a bit of extra flour to ensure the pastry doesn’t stick to your work surface.
