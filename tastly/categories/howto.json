Mix the yeast into the water and let it sit for a couple minutes.\nAdd in the rest of the ingredients for the starter. Mix well until everything is fully incorporated.\nWrap the bowl with clear wrap, making sure not to tightly seal the bowl. Let the starter breathe a little and keep it in a dark place at room temperature. Stir once a day for 5 days until making the dough. The starter will rise and shrink each day and you should see bubbles, letting you know that the yeast is being activated!\nOn day 5, combine all ingredients into a bowl, and knead for 10 minutes on low if using a machine; if kneading by hand, knead for 20 minutes until dough is stretchy yet doesn’t stick to your hands.\nPlace kneaded dough into a large bowl with a towel over the top, and let it rise for 12 hours.\nPlace risen dough onto a floured board and knead for a few minutes. Place it into a proofing basket or a medium bowl and let it rise for another 4 hours.\nPreheat oven to 480°F/250°C.\nFlip the dough onto a parchment paper, and transfer the dough and paper into a large cast-iron dutch oven. \nScore the top of the bread. \nPlace the lid on top and bake for 30 minutes.\nTake the lid off and bake for another 15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.\nTransfer onto a cooling rack and let it rest for an hour. Knock the bottom of the bread to listen for a hollow knock. \nEnjoy it however you like!\n\nFeeding your starter.\nYour starter will last forever as long as you maintain and care for it. It can stay in the fridge and be fed once a week with a teaspoon of sugar.\nTo replenish your starter, simply add 1 cup of flour and ½ cup of water, mix, and place it back in the fridge. \nLeave it out overnight to get to room temperature before preparing the dough.\n\nInspired by:\nMitch Bishop\nhttps://www.theperfectloaf.com/beginners-sourdough-bread/\nhttp://www.mykitchenaddiction.com/2012/01/make-your-own-sourdough-starter/\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nMUSIC\nFeels Alright_NoLdVoxVoxFx\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/10624","date":"2017-04-24T22:00:56.000Z"},{"id":"FTha4zARGN4","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/FTha4zARGN4/0.jpg","title":"How To Cook Perfect Hard-Boiled Eggs","description":"Here is what you'll need!\n\nCheck out the Tasty One-Stop Shop for cookbooks, aprons, hats, and more at TastyShop.com: http://bit.ly/2mEBY0e.\n\nPerfect Hard-Boiled Eggs\nServings: 6\n\nINGREDIENTS\n6 eggs\nWater, to cover\nIce, for ice bath\n\nPREPARATION\nPlace eggs in a pot.

Once boiling, take off the heat.\nCover and cook for 4-16 minutes, depending on preference (4-6 minutes for soft-boiled, 8-10 minutes for medium-boiled, 12-16 minutes for hard-boiled). In the meantime, fill a large bowl with ice and cold water, creating an ice bath.\nOnce eggs reach desired cook-time, immediately remove the eggs from pot and place in the ice bath. Allow eggs to cool for 10-15 minutes.\nTo peel, lightly tap the eggs on a flat surface, then gently roll back and forth (taking extra care with soft-boiled eggs). \nPull away the loosened shell and peel any remaining pieces.\nServe as is or incorporate into your favorite recipe that requires hard-boiled eggs.\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network\n\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/15195","date":"2017-04-23T16:00:20.000Z"},{"id":"ten1TUF0dzo","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/ten1TUF0dzo/0.jpg","title":"How To Regrow Fruit From Your Kitchen","description":"Check out the Tasty One-Stop Shop for cookbooks, aprons, hats, and more at TastyShop.com: http://bit.ly/2mEBY0e\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nHow To Regrow Fruit From Your Kitchen\n\nNEED:\nStrawberry\nRaspberry\nTomato\nLemon\nOrange\nAvocado\nPineapple\nMason jars or cups\nToothpicks\nAll-purpose or seed-starting soil\n\nStrawberries\nRemove seeds from strawberry with a toothpick.\nRinse the seeds off so no fruit is left on them then let them dry off completely.\nFill a container almost all the way with all-purpose or seed-starting soil and flick the seeds into it.\nCover seeds with ¼ inch of soil.\nSpray water on seeds, repeat every other day\nLeave seeds in sunlight\nWatch for seeds to sprout.\nTransfer to soil once sprouts grow their third leaves\n\nRaspberries\nRemove seeds from strawberry with a toothpick or by mashing a raspberry through a strainer.\nRinse the seeds off so no fruit is left on them then let them dry off completely.\nFill a container almost all the way with all-purpose or seed-starting soil and flick the seeds into it.\nCover seeds with ¼ inch of soil.\nSpray water on seeds, repeat every other day\nLeave seeds in sunlight\nTransfer to soil once sprouts grow their third leaves\n\nTomatoes\nSlice tomato into thirds horizontally.\nTake any of the thirds and place them in a cup or jar filled ¾ of the way with all-purpose soil.\nCover the last fourth with soil to cover the tomato.\nMoisten soil considerably and leave in direct sunlight\nSpray water on seeds, repeat every other day\nWatch for seeds to sprout!\n\n\nCitrus\nSlice citrus in half and remove seeds.\nRinse seeds off but do not allow to dry\nFill a container ¾ of the way with all-purpose or seed-starting soil. \nRinse the seeds off so no fruit is left on them then let them dry off completely.\nFill a container ¾ of the way with all-purpose or seed-starting soil. \nLeave seeds in a warm place (on a refrigerator or near a water heater)\nSpray water on seeds, repeat every other day\nWatch for seeds to sprout!\n\n\nAvocado\nSlice an avocado in half and remove the seed.\nRinse the seed off and allow to dry.\nPoke toothpicks in 3 sides of the seed.\nPlace seed in a glass of water, relying on the toothpicks to hold it up so that only the bottom quarter of the seed is in the water (pointed end should be facing up out of the water).
