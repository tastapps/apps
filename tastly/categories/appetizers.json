Check out his website: http://wolfgangpuck.com/catering\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nSalmon with Pesto Veggie Noodles by Wolfgang Puck\nServings: 2\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 shallot\n2 cloves garlic\n5 large leaves basil\n¬º bunch flat leaf parsley\n1 pint cherry tomatoes\n1 teaspoon chili flakes\nSalt, to taste\nPepper, to taste\n1 lemon\n¬º cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for cooking\n2 6-ounce fillets of salmon, skin off\n1 yellow squash\n1 zucchini\n2 carrots\n2 watermelon radishes\n\nPREPARATION\nFinely dice the shallot and add it to a medium bowl. \nMince the garlic and add it to the bowl with the shallot. \nChiffonade the basil, chop the parsley, and add to the bowl. \nQuarter the cherry tomatoes and add them to the bowl with the herbs, along with the chili flakes, a pinch of salt and pepper, the juice of one lemon, and the olive oil. Stir to combine.\nHeat a bit of oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. \nSeason the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. When the oil is shimmering, sear the salmon on one side until golden brown. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown and the fish is cooked through. Remove the salmon from the heat and wipe out the skillet.\nCut the squash, zucchini, carrots, and watermelon radishes in half, if needed, then spiralize.\nHeat a bit of oil in the pan over medium heat until simmering. \nAdd the vegetable noodles to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Saute until tender, about 2 minutes. \nDivide the vegetable noodles between two plates. \nPlace a piece of salmon on each bed of noodles, then top with tomato sauce.\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nWolfgang Puck's Trout in Puff Pastry\nServings: 6\n\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n¬Ω cup celery, sliced \n¬Ω cup leeks, julienned\n¬Ω cup carrots, julienned\nSalt, to taste\nWhite pepper, to taste\n1 cup heavy cream\n1 whole trout, cleaned\nBlack pepper, to taste\n2 tablespoons fresh tarragon, chopped\n2 sheets puff pastry\n2 eggs, beaten\nParsley, for serving\nLemon wedges, for serving\n\nChive Butter Sauce:\n1 cup white wine\nJuice of one lemon\n4 shallots, minced\n¬Ω bunch tarragon \n1 cup heavy cream\n18 tablespoons (2 ¬º sticks) butter, sliced\nSalt, to taste\nPepper, to taste\n2 bunches chives, minced\n \nPREPARATION\nHeat the olive oil in a medium pan over medium heat. \nAdd the celery, leeks, carrots, and a pinch of salt and white pepper, and saut√© until the vegetables start to cook down. \nAdd the cream and stir to coat the vegetables.

Use a paring knife to cut away the excess puff pastry in the shape of a fish. \nBrush the top of the puff pastry with egg wash and use the leftover pastry scraps to decorate the fish with an eye and gills. Use the tip of the knife or the large opening of a pastry tip to draw scales on the body and tail. \nChill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.\nMake the Chive Butter Sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the wine, lemon juice, shallots, and tarragon.

Mix the yeast into the water and let it sit for a couple minutes.\nAdd in the rest of the ingredients for the starter. Mix well until everything is fully incorporated.\nWrap the bowl with clear wrap, making sure not to tightly seal the bowl. Let the starter breathe a little and keep it in a dark place at room temperature. Stir once a day for 5 days until making the dough. The starter will rise and shrink each day and you should see bubbles, letting you know that the yeast is being activated!\nOn day 5, combine all ingredients into a bowl, and knead for 10 minutes on low if using a machine; if kneading by hand, knead for 20 minutes until dough is stretchy yet doesn‚Äôt stick to your hands.\nPlace kneaded dough into a large bowl with a towel over the top, and let it rise for 12 hours.\nPlace risen dough onto a floured board and knead for a few minutes. Place it into a proofing basket or a medium bowl and let it rise for another 4 hours.\nPreheat oven to 480¬∞F/250¬∞C.\nFlip the dough onto a parchment paper, and transfer the dough and paper into a large cast-iron dutch oven. \nScore the top of the bread. \nPlace the lid on top and bake for 30 minutes.\nTake the lid off and bake for another 15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.\nTransfer onto a cooling rack and let it rest for an hour. Knock the bottom of the bread to listen for a hollow knock. \nEnjoy it however you like!\n\nFeeding your starter.\nYour starter will last forever as long as you maintain and care for it. It can stay in the fridge and be fed once a week with a teaspoon of sugar.\nTo replenish your starter, simply add 1 cup of flour and ¬Ω cup of water, mix, and place it back in the fridge. \nLeave it out overnight to get to room temperature before preparing the dough.\n\nInspired by:\nMitch Bishop\nhttps://www.theperfectloaf.com/beginners-sourdough-bread/\nhttp://www.mykitchenaddiction.com/2012/01/make-your-own-sourdough-starter/\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nMUSIC\nFeels Alright_NoLdVoxVoxFx\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/10624","date":"2017-04-24T22:00:56.000Z"},{"id":"dK_4780KJZQ","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/dK_4780KJZQ/0.jpg","title":"Herbed Flatbread (Focaccia) 4- ways","description":"Here is what you'll need!\n\nHerbed Flatbread (Focaccia) 4 Ways\nServings: 4\n\nINGREDIENTS\nBread\n1¬Ω cups warm water\n1 pack active dry yeast\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n4 cups (500 grams) all-purpose flour\n1 tablespoon salt\n¬Ω teaspoon dried thyme\n¬Ω teaspoon black pepper\n¬Ω teaspoon fresh rosemary \n\nToppings\nMixed tomatoes (about 8 ounces)\nFresh rosemary\nCaramelized onions \n2 cloves garlic, minced\nMixed olives (about 8 ounces)\nParmesan cheese\nMozzarella cheese\nGorgonzola cheese \n\nPREPARATION\nStir yeast packet into water and allow yeast to bloom. (A light foam should appear on top of the water after about 5 minutes. This means the yeast is alive and active.) Add olive oil to water and mix. \nIn a large bowl, mix flour, salt, and herbs together. Once incorporated, create a small well in the middle and pour in the water/yeast/oil mixture.\nMix by hand, wetting your working hand before mixing so the dough doesn‚Äôt stick to your fingers. The water and flour should come together and form a rough dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour in small increments, about 1 tablespoon at a time. If the dough is too dry, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Once the dough begins to come together, turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead the dough until it forms a smooth ball. Coat the bowl the dough was initially mixed in with about a tablespoon of olive oil and place the dough ball inside. Give it a few turns to coat the dough in the oil. Cover and let the dough rise until it doubles in size (1-1.5 hours). \nWhile the dough rises, prepare a large baking sheet by generously coating it with olive oil. \nOnce the dough has risen, turn it out onto the prepared baking sheet and flatten it out into a large rectangle. Using a knife or dough scraper, cut the dough into 4 evenly sized rectangles. Press the rectangles flat and arrange them with each one pressed into a corner of the baking sheet. Cover and let the dough rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450ÀöF/230ÀöC while the dough is resting. \nUncover the dough. Depending on the temperature of your kitchen and activeness of the yeast, the 4 rectangles should have risen to be about an inch think. Using your fingers, poke the the dough all over--creating small dimples across the surface. \nGenerously coat the tops of the dough rectangles one last time with olive oil (some oil will pool inside of the divots we made with our fingers. That‚Äôs ok!) Use a basting brush to ensure all of the dough gets covered with olive oil. \nTop the dough rectangles with your choice of toppings. (We did four different combinations, including tomatoes with fresh rosemary, caramelized onions and parmesan cheese, mixed olive with gorgonzola cheese, and 3-cheese using parmesan, mozzarella, and gorgonzola.) Once finished with the toppings, liberally sprinkle the breads with a coarse salt. \nBake at 450ÀöF/230ÀöC for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.\nAllow the bread to cool for 10 minutes before cutting. \nEnjoy! \n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nMUSIC\nRailroading\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/13846","date":"2017-04-02T22:00:57.000Z"},{"id":"w2V2WvEs5e0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/w2V2WvEs5e0/0.jpg","title":"Chicken Parm Bites","description":"Here is what you'll need!\n\nChicken Parm Bites\nServings: 2-3\n \nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound chicken tenders\n1 ball mozzarella cheese\n2 cups panko bread crumbs\n1 tablespoon garlic powder\n1 tablespoon dried basil\n1 tablespoon dried parsley\n1 tablespoon salt\n¬Ω cup flour\n2 eggs\nOil to fry\n1 cup marinara sauce\n \nPREPARATION\n1.

(A light foam should appear on top of the water after about 5 minutes. This means the yeast is alive and active.)\nIn a large bowl, mix flour and salt by hand. Once incorporated, create a small well in the middle and pour in the water/yeast mixture.\nMix by hand, wetting your working hand before mixing so the dough doesn‚Äôt stick to your fingers. The water and flour should come together and a form rough dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour in small increments, about 1 tablespoon at a time. If the dough is too dry, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Once the dough has come together, cover it and let it rise until it doubles in size (about 1.5 to 2 hours).\nUncover the dough and give it a few pokes with your finger. If the dough has risen properly it should indent under the pressure of your fingers and slowly deflate. \nUsing your hand or a rubber spatula fold the dough. Starting from the rim of the bowl, work the dough loose from the sides and fold it up and towards the center of the bowl. Turn the bowl 90 degrees, and repeat until all the dough has been pulled from the sides and folded towards the center. Once finished, cover and allow the dough to continue to rise for another 1.5-2 hours. \nOnce the dough has doubled in size again, gently remove it from the bowl onto a lightly floured surface and sprinkle a small amount of flour on top of the dough. Using your hands, begin to shape the loaf. Fold the dough under itself several times to form a ball, then claps together the seams of dough underneath. Place the dough seam-side down in a clean bowl that has been coated with olive oil and flour. Cover and let rise for 1 hour. \nMeanwhile, take a 6-quart dutch oven (or heavy cooking pot with oven-safe lid) and place it inside the oven. Preheat the oven to 450ÀöF/230ÀöC and allow it to heat up with the pot inside for 45 minutes. \nRemove the pot from the oven and place it on a trivet or heat-safe surface. (Be careful! It‚Äôll be VERY HOT.) Turn the proofed dough over onto a lightly floured surface and carefully place it inside of the pot. Cover with the lid and return the pot to the oven. \nBake at 450ÀöF/230ÀöC for 45 minutes,removing the lid for the last 15 minutes. \nRemove bread from pot and allow to cool for 10 minutes before cutting.\nEnjoy!\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nMUSIC\nSunglass\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/10488","date":"2017-02-13T23:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"Wi8B5w3LyRM","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/Wi8B5w3LyRM/0.jpg","title":"Pesto Chicken Garlic Knot Sliders","description":"Customize & buy the Tasty Cookbook here: http://bzfd.it/2fpfeu5\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nPESTO CHICKEN GARLIC KNOT SLIDERS\nServings: 16 sliders\n\nINGREDIENTS\nPizza dough (2 pies worth, or about 1.5-2 lbs)\n3 cups rotisserie chicken, shredded\n1 8-ounce jar of pesto\n2 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded\n3 tablespoons salted butter, melted\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped \n\nPREPARATION\nPreheat oven to 400ÀöF/200ÀöC.\nCut pizza dough into eighths.

Once all the knots are placed in the dish, cover and let rest for 10 minutes.\nUncover and bake for 12 minutes or until the slider buns are golden brown and no doughy grey bits remain.\nOnce the knots are out of the oven, lower the oven temperature to 350ÀöF/180ÀöC.\nAllow the knots to cool, carefully remove them from the baking dish and cut the grid horizontally,creating both a top and bottom piece. (NOTE: It‚Äôs helpful to hold the knots together with a towel on top while cutting them horizontally, as the motion of the knife might cause some of them to pull apart.)\nReturn the bottom half of the knot-grid to the original baking dish. Evenly layer the bread with cooked chicken, followed by the pesto and mozzarella cheese. Place the top half of the garlic knots on top. \nMix together melted butter, garlic, and parsley. Brush mixture liberally over the top of the knots.\nBake at 350ÀöF/180ÀöC for an additional 10 minutes until the tops of the knots are golden brown and cheese is melted. \nPull apart for individual sliders. \nEnjoy!\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nMUSIC\nGridiron\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/11275","date":"2017-02-11T18:00:33.000Z"},{"id":"bZNry6R1o4Y","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/bZNry6R1o4Y/0.jpg","title":"Mini Calzones 4 Ways","description":"Customize & buy the Tasty Cookbook here: http://bzfd.it/2fpfeu5\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nMini Calzones 4 Ways\n\nMEATBALL PARMESAN CALZONES\nServings: 8 \n\nINGRIDIENTS \n1 16-ounce package pizza dough\n8 tablespoons marinara sauce\n16 frozen party-size meatballs, thawed\n4 slices mozzarella, cut in half\n4 tablespoons parmesan, grated\nFresh basil\nBlack pepper, for topping\n\nEgg wash\n1 egg \n1 tablespoon water \n\nPREPARATION\n1.

To cut into fries, cut a small sliver off the edge of the potatoes lengthwise to create a flat side for them to rest on. Turn the potato over to lay on its flat side. Then cut lengthwise into 4-5 long slices (or 1/4-3/8 inch slices). Cut each slice lengthwise into 3-4 fries (1/4-3/8 inch).\n\nPlace the fries in a bowl of water and soak for 1 hour. (This helps remove excess starch from the potatoes so your fries will be crispier.) \n\nPreheat the oven to 425¬∞F / 220¬∞C.\n\nRinse and dry off. In a large bowl or gallon bag, toss the fries with cornstarch until they‚Äôre evenly coated. Then add the oil and toss to coat. Add the pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and brown sugar and toss to evenly distribute your spices. (Hold off on adding the salt until after baking. This will help make sure the fries are crispy.) \n\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Lay out the french fries, being sure not to overcrowd the pan. (You may need two pans, depending on how large your pans are. Avoid overcrowding one pan or your fries may not crisp up.) \n\nBake for 15 minutes. Flip fries with tongs, then bake for an additional 10-15 minutes.\n\nSprinkle on salt (to taste) and serve! Add shredded parmesan and chopped parsley for an optional garnish. Enjoy with your favorite dipping sauce!\n\nAll music provided by Audio Network and Warner Chappell Inc.
