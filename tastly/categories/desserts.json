Melt the milk chocolate in a microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring in between each until smooth. \n2. Open a 6-inch fillable ornament, then pour the chocolate into one of the halves.\n3. Close the ornament, rotating the ball so that the chocolate evenly coats the entire surface. You may have to shake a bit to eventually get the chocolate to fill in any holes.\n4. Place the ball the freezer, then flip it after two minutes. Repeat this 2-3 times. The chocolate should be set by then. Freeze for at least 30 minutes.\n5. Remove the ball from the freezer. Making sure to be extremely careful, open the ornament. Making sure you work quickly and that you don‚Äôt touch the ball for too long with your warm hands, remove the ball from the other half. If you want to be extra safe, place the ball back into the freezer in a bowl until it‚Äôs ready for the next step.\n6. Dip or run a flat-bottomed bowl in boiling water, then dry the entire bowl. Invert the bowl onto a flat surface, then place one side of the frozen chocolate ball on the hot bowl. \n7. Twist back and forth with a gentle motion, making sure that you‚Äôre not applying too much pressure to the ball, as it is very fragile. Use a paper towel to help insulate the ball from your warm fingers. You may have to reheat and wipe off the bowl a few times as it will cool down a bit. Place the ball back in the freezer.\n8. On a large plate, stack the brownies on top of each other, then surround them with berries. Place a scoop of ice cream on top of the brownies, then slowly place the chocolate ball on top. \n9. To cover up any holes or imperfections along the seam where the ball touches the plate, surround the base of the ball with more berries.\n10. Microwave the dark chocolate with the heavy cream in 20-second intervals until smooth and glossy.\n11. Pour the chocolate sauce over the ball in a circular motion. \n12.

The layer should be a little less than an inch thick. Place the loaf pan in the freezer for 10-15 minutes to allow the ice cream to firm up. \nRepeat step 1 for both the vanilla and strawberry ice cream until the loaf pan is filled with the 3 layers. Return the loaf pan to the freezer and allow it to freeze completely, about 2 hours. \nPrepare toppings before removing the loaf pan from the freezer. Combine the chocolate with the coconut oil and melt by microwaving, stirring every 20 seconds, until fully melted. Add crispy rice to melted chocolate if desired. \nRemove the loaf pan from the freezer and transfer to a cutting board. Take the popsicle sticks and press them firmly into the top of the ice cream, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Using a pair of scissors, quickly cut the outer rim of the aluminium pan. This should allow you to peel it away and reveal the layered block of ice cream. Once the pan is removed, cut the ice cream between the sticks making 8-9 individual pops. \nDip the pops in the melted chocolate and transfer them to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.

Cover the tops of each bowl with plastic wrap and press down onto the surface of the custard to prevent skin from forming. Chill in the refrigerator. \n7. In a pot, combine the water, salt, and butter, bringing it to a boil. Add the flour and stir until the dough comes together in a ball. Remove from heat.\n8. Add in the eggs, one a time, stirring until the dough becomes a paste. Add the vanilla and stir to combine. Transfer the dough into a piping bag with a large round tip.\n9. On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, pipe 1-inch mounds.\n10. Bake for 20 minutes until the pastry has risen considerably and the insides are dry.\n11. Allow the pastries to cool. Then, using the tip of a knife, cut a small ‚Äúx‚Äù into the bottom of each pastry and transfer (‚Äúx‚Äù side up) to a cooling rack. This will allow any excess steam or moisture to escape, ensuring your pastries maintain their shape.\n13. Transfer the custard to a piping back alternating the colors in order for the custard to swirl inside the pastry. Fill each pastry with custard.\n14. In a bowl, melt the white chocolate chips and vanilla, and swirl teal, pink, and purple dye in order to create a purple marble shell.\n15.

Beat until lemon-colored and fluffy.\nHeat the cream in a pot over medium heat until steaming but not boiling, then slowly mix in half of the cream with the eggs ‚Äì being sure to not cook the eggs by pouring too much cream inside before it‚Äôs mixed. \nPour the warm creamy egg mixture into the pot with the rest of the cream and cook over low heat, stirring constantly until the mixture has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon without dripping off too much. \nMix in the white chocolate until smooth, then transfer the mix to a bowl and press cling film into the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill completely.\nOnce the white chocolate mixture is set, beat the cold cream in a large bowl until stiff peaks. Be careful not to overmix, it‚Äôs safer to undermix than the over mix.\nCarefully fold in the white chocolate mixture into the cream, a little at a time, until folded in completely. Set aside for later use.\n\n\nMirror Glaze\nServings: 1\n\nINGREDIENTS\n300 milliliters water\n1¬Ω cups sugar\n1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk\n15 gelatin sheets\n26 ounces white chocolate, chopped (over 30% cocoa butter)\nGel food coloring of choice\n\nPREPARATION\nBoil the water, sugar, and condensed milk in a pot for 1 minute, then remove from heat.\nBloom the gelatin in 8 cups of cold water for 5 minutes, then wring the gelatin sheets of excess water and mix into the sugar mixture.\nPour the liquid over the chocolate, letting it sit for 2-3 minutes to allow the chocolate to soften.\nUsing an immersion blender, carefully blend the chocolate and the liquid, making sure that you are not blending in air bubbles by lifting up the blender too high. It‚Äôs okay to go slow, just make sure it‚Äôs all blended with as little bubbles as possible, which will show up in the final product.\nSieve the mix into a large jug or vertical container to remove any excess bubbles. If there are still bubbles, continue to sieve back and forth. A trick to remove air bubbles from the surface is to manually pop them with a toothpick or to press cling film into the surface and remove the bubbles.\nSeparate the glaze into different containers and color them to your desire. We used red and white for this cake. Blend the coloring with the glaze until the color is distributed evenly, then cover each container with the cling film, pressing the film into the glaze to ensure that there is no skin when you are ready to use the glaze. \nWhen you are ready to use the glaze, make sure each one is around 90-96¬∞F, then pour the colored glazes back into one container. Swirl them if you‚Äôd like, then glaze your cake!\n\n\nMirror Glaze Cake\nServings: 8-10\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 recipe White Chocolate Mousse\n18 ounces strawberry jam, seedless\n2 round vanilla cakes, prepared with box instructions and trimmed to 1 cm thick\n1 recipe Mirror Glaze\n\nPREPARATION\nSpread the jam evenly into the bottom of a round 8-inch cake pan, then place one of the cake rounds on top.

Press the cake down slightly, then cover it with the rest of the mousse. Place the 2nd cake round on top, pressing down until the mousse rises to the level of the cake. Carefully transfer to a freezer and freeze overnight. It is vital that the cake is 100% frozen through.\nPlace a can on top of a baking sheet, then carefully unmold the cake onto the can.

Alternatively, a food processor can be used to crush the cookies.\nPour the cookie crumbs into a medium bowl with the melted butter and brown sugar. Mix until the crumbs take on the character of a coarse, wet sand. \n Pour the crumbs into a 9-inch spring pan. Press the crumb firmly into the pan, making sure to coat the bottom evenly. Once the crust has been formed, place it in the refrigerator to firm up. \nAdd cream cheese, melted chocolate, cocoa powder, and sugar to a large bowl and whisk, either by hand or with an electric mixer, until all the ingredients are incorporated. (NOTE: If mixing by hand, it is recommended to microwave the cream cheese before whisking in order to soften it up.) Add vanilla extract and eggs, and continue to whisk until mixture is smooth and glossy.\nIn a separate bowl, combine heavy cream and powdered sugar. Whisk until the cream develops a mousse-y texture and soft peaks form. \nAdding a small amount at a time, carefully fold in the whipped cream into the cream cheese batter, being careful not to let the air out of the fluffy mixture. Fold just until incorporated.\nOnce combined, pour the batter over the prepared cookie crust inside the springform pan. Use a spatula to smooth out the top. Give the pan a slight jiggle to release any large air bubbles that may be trapped in the batter. \nPlace the filled pan on top of a sheet of aluminium foil and fold the foil up the sides on the outside of the pan. Then place the wrapped pan into a larger baking pan or dish lined with 2 paper towels at the bottom. The aluminium foil will keep water from seeping into the bottom of the pan and the paper towels ensure that the heat is distributed evenly along the bottom of the pan. Fill the larger pan with about 1 inch of hot water.\nBake at 300ÀöF/150ÀöC for 60-70 minutes--checking every 15-20 minutes to add more hot water to the larger dish, as necessary.\nOnce out of the oven, immediately run a small sharp knife around the outside of the cheesecake to release it from the pan. Allow the cheesecake to cool completely before removing it from the pan. \nPrepare the ganache by combining chocolate chips with hot cream. Stir until chocolate is completely melted and ganache is smooth and glossy. \nPour ganache evenly over the cooled cheesecake. Refrigerate the ganache covered cake for 30 minutes before cutting and serving. \nEnjoy!  \n\n\nSources/Reference\nhttp://www.rockrecipes.com/chocolate-mousse-cheesecake/\nhttp://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/chocolate-mousse-cheesecake\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nMUSIC\nBoss Eyed Bossa\n\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/12507","date":"2017-03-05T17:00:36.000Z"},{"id":"k3jx_Box_4k","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/k3jx_Box_4k/0.jpg","title":"Sopapilla Cheesecake Bars | Episode 1144","description":"To get this complete recipe with instructions and measurements, check out my website: http://www.LauraintheKitchen.com\n\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/mrsvitale\n\nOfficial Facebook Page: http://www.facebook.com/LauraintheKitchen\n\nContact: Business@LauraintheKitchen.com\n\nTwitter: @Lauraskitchen","date":"2017-03-04T16:36:05.000Z"},{"id":"lPQLqEhWWLA","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/lPQLqEhWWLA/0.jpg","title":"Easy Peach Cobbler","description":"Customize & buy the Tasty Cookbook here: http://bzfd.it/2fpfeu5\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nEASY PEACH COBBLER\nServings: 12\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 29-ounce can of peaches in heavy syrup\n1 box yellow cake mix\n¬Ω cup butter, thinly sliced\nVanilla ice cream, optional\n\nPREPARATION\nPreheat oven to 375¬∞F/190¬∞C.\nIn a 9x18 glass baking dish, spread the peaches and syrup.\nEvenly sprinkle the cake mix over the peaches, and pat down.\nLay the butter evenly over the cake mix.\nBake for 45 minutes.\nTop with vanilla ice cream.\nEnjoy!\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nMUSIC\nGetting the Groove Back Main\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/10821","date":"2017-03-02T03:00:18.000Z"},{"id":"rxccyenOad0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/rxccyenOad0/0.jpg","title":"4 Vegan Dessert Recipes","description":"Customize & buy the Tasty Cookbook here: http://bzfd.it/2fpfeu5\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nMINT COOKIES\nServings: 5\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup chocolate chips\n¬Ω teaspoon mint extract\n1 tablespoon vegetable shortening\n24 crackers\n\nPREPARATION\n1.

The filling should be smooth and airy when finished. \nPour the filling mixture into the refrigerated graham cracker crust and bake at 350ÀöF/180ÀöC for 18-20 minutes, or until the edges of the crust begin to brown and the filling no longer jiggles when disturbed. \nWhile the pie is baking, combine the reserved egg whites with corn syrup and about ¬º cup of the sugar and begin to whisk vigorously to form the meringue. Continue to add the sugar in small increments until all of it is incorporated. Continue to whisk until mixture thickens and stiff peaks form, about 7-10 minutes. \nTop the baked pie with the meringue. Using a rubber spatula, spread the meringue evenly over the top of the pie, making sure to cover all the visible areas of filling. Once covered, use the tip of the spatula to shape the meringue forming small peaks a valleys in the topping. \nBake at 350Àö/180ÀöC for an additional 7-10 minutes to toast the meringue topping. Allow to cool completely for at least 1 hour before cutting. \nEnjoy!\nSources/Credit\nhttp://jesspryles.com/key-lime-pie/\nhttp://relish.com/recipes/the-ultimate-key-lime-pie/\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nMUSIC\nMambo Cabana\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/11947","date":"2017-02-23T17:00:46.000Z"},{"id":"CMGP6rPCmpA","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/CMGP6rPCmpA/0.jpg","title":"6-Ingredient No-Bake Caramel Tarts","description":"Customize & buy the Tasty Cookbook here: http://bzfd.it/2fpfeu5\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\n6-INGREDIENT NO-BAKE CARAMEL TARTS\nServings: 20 \n\nINGREDIENTS\n24 chocolate cream cookies\n4 tablespoon butter, melted\n1¬Ω cup sugar\n¬Ω cup water\n¬Ω cup heavy cream\n¬Ω teaspoon vanilla\n¬Ω cup heavy cream\n6 ounces dark chocolate \n\nTopping\nSea salt\n\nPREPARATION\nPlace cookies into plastic bag and smash until fine crumbles form, or use a food processor and make it as fine as possible.\nIn a large bowl, combine cookie crumbs and melted butter and mix until it clusters.\nIn a cupcake tin, put a spoonful of the crumb mixture and form into crusts.\nFreeze for 2 hours.\nIn a medium saucepan, heat sugar and water until amber brown.

Halve apples across the middle creating both a top and bottom piece. Using a melon baller remove the core, being careful not to go completely through the bottom. Once the core is removed, continue using the melon baller to carve out the interior of the apple, keeping the small pieces of apple seperate. \nIn a small bowl, combine the carved out apple pieces with the white sugar, cinnamon, cornstarch, and softened butter. Mix until apple pieces are evenly coated. \nLay puff pastry out on a lightly floured surface. With a rolling pin, spread pastry out to make a sheet measuring roughly 9x14 inches. Using the round top of a sauce pan (ideally 6-7 inches in diameter), cut 2 circles of pastry out of each sheet and set them aside.\nSpoon filling into the hollowed-out core of the apples and place each filled apple in the middle of a round piece of pastry. Apply a light wash of egg white to the rim of the pastry and fold toward the center over the apple, crimping the pastry as the edges meet. Continue until all the edges have been brought together. Use your hands to keep shape of the dumpling. Once shaped, brush more egg white over the top of each dumpling. Lastly, using a small pairing knife, cut a small vent into the top of each dumpling. \nBake for 18-22 minutes in a preheated oven, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbling. \n\nCider Sauce \nWhile dumplings are baking combine water, apple cider, sugar, and cinnamon in a saucepan and bring it to a boil.

Preheat oven to 425ÀöF (220ÀöC)\n2. In a medium saucepan, add the butter, water, and salt over medium heat. Allow all the butter to melt and bring the mixture to a boil. \n3. As soon as the mixture begins to boil, reduce heat to medium-low and add in the flour and graham cracker crumbs. Using a wooden spoon, mix thoroughly to combine.\n4. Continue stirring (about two minutes). The dough should form into a ball and easily pull away from the sided of the pan. Remove the mixture from heat and leave to cool for 5 minutes.\n5. Add in the eggs to the cooled dough, one at a time, being sure to fully incorporate each egg before adding the next. (The eggs will initially be difficult to incorporate into the dough - but continue stirring vigorously and they will eventually come together to form a smooth shiny dough) \n6. Once the dough comes together, transfer it to a piping bag and pipe onto a parchment-paper-lined baking sheet into 2-3 inch logs. \n7. Smooth out any peaks/tails caused by piping with a wet fingertip (this will ensure your eclairs cook evenly and maintain an even shape)\n8. Brush the eclairs with beaten egg.\n9. Bake in a preheated oven for 10 minutes at 425ÀöF. Then, without opening the oven, reduce heat to 350Àö (175ÀöC) and bake for an additional 15 minutes.\n10. Remove eclairs from oven. Using the tip of a knife, cut a small ‚Äúx‚Äù into the bottom of each eclair and transfer (‚Äúx‚Äù side up) to a cooling rack. (this will allow any excess steam/moisture to escape ensuring your eclairs maintain their shape). \n11. Fill a piping bag fitted with a narrow tip with marshmallow fluff. \n12. Just before serving, pipe the fluff into the cooled eclairs. \n13. Break apart chocolate and add to a small microwave safe bowl. \n14. To a separate, small microwave safe bowl, add the heavy cream.\n15. Microwave the cream for one minute. Remove and immediately pour the hot cream over the chocolate pieces. Stir until the chocolate has melted and a nice ganache has formed. (if necessary place the bowl with chocolate and cream in the microwave for 10 second increments, stirring after each until smooth). \n16. Dip the top side of the filled eclairs into the melted chocolate. \n16. Sprinkle with additional graham cracker crumbs and top with mini marshmallows (if you have a kitchen torch you can ‚Äútoast‚Äù the marshmallows to make them super cute) \n16. Best served immediately.
