Once the roots have grown to ¼ -½ inch long, remove from water and drain the can. Make holes in the bottom of the can for drainage using a hammer and a nail. \n7. Fill ⅓ of the can with small rocks and fill the rest of the can with potting soil. Stick your finger into the soil to your second knuckle, and place the rooted cuttings in the divot. Top with more soil and pack down. Spray soil with water.\n8. Place in a well-lit area that gets up to 6 hours of sunlight, and keep soil moist.\n9.
