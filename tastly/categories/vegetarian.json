On a cutting board, cut two inches of the base of lettuce off.\n2. Set the lettuce on its base in a glass with ½ inch of water, and place it in sunlight. Change the water every day.\n3.

I'm really excited about this recipe for grilled-pepper-and-tomato bruschetta because it's bright, summery, and comes together in just a few minutes.\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nGet started by brushing slices of thick, crusty bread with olive oil before adding them to a hot grill (you could also do this in the oven, if you're working inside), along with your peppers. While those are cooking, you'll quarter some cherry tomatoes (they're cute that way!) and add them to a bowl with capers, olive oil, red wine vinegar and salt. Mix the peppers with the tomatoes before piling everything on top of your grilled bread. This appetizer is such a crowd-pleaser, I have a feeling you won't have any leftovers!\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIngredients:\n2 orange bell peppers, halved lengthwise\n1 pint cherry tomatoes, quartered\n3 tablespoons capers, rinsed and drained\n2 tablespoons red-wine vinegar\n4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\nCoarse salt and ground pepper\n8 slices crusty bread, toasted\n1 ounce Parmesan cheese, shaved\n\nDirections:\nHeat grill to medium-high.

Watch as I transform ordinary vinaigrette into a deeply flavored dressing that's perfect for hearty dinner salads. I'll also show you how to use it to make the perfect party hors d'oeuvre and to turn ordinary mashed potatoes into a super-special side.\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\nRoasted Garlic Vinaigrette\nGive your red-wine vinaigrette an instant upgrade by adding 1 tablespoon roasted garlic to about 1/2 cup vinaigrette. Mix in a widemouthed jar until thoroughly combined, smashing garlic on the sides of the jar with a spoon, if necessary. This dressing works best on heartier salad greens, like romaine, escarole, or kale. \n\nRoasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes\nPeel, cube, and cook 3 pounds of potatoes. When they're fork-tender, drain thoroughly and place in a mixing bowl. Add 1 cup half-and-half (you can substitute buttermilk for a lower-fat version), 4 tablespoons butter, and 2 heads roasted garlic. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mash with a potato masher until they reach the desired consistency. (Be sure not to overmash -- that toughens the potatoes). Enjoy!\n\nRoasted Garlic Crostini\nTo make crostini, preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Slice a baguette into 1/4-inch slices and place on two large rimmed baking sheets. Brush slices with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake until golden, about 15 minutes. When they've cooled, spread a little roasted garlic on each, and top with diced tomatoes (salt if desired) and shaved Parmesan cheese.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more?

(Hint: It's roasted garlic.) This incredibly easy, high-impact ingredient can be added to everything (omelets, soups), stirred into sauces, or simply spread on bread or crackers for a savory snack.  \n \nYes, this recipe makes a ton of roasted garlic. Don't worry: It can keep for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator -- but I doubt you'll have it for that long. And in case you need more ideas for using it up, come back tomorrow and I'll show you how it enhances standard mashed potatoes, makes a fabulous crostini (party app, anyone?), or just adds depth to your regular vinaigrette.\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecipe Ingredients:\n8 heads garlic\nOlive oil\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\nFresh herbs, such as thyme or rosemary (optional)\n\nGet the Full Recipe: http://www.marthastewart.com/350091/roasted-garlic\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more?
