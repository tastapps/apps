Science tells us there is no genetic or scientific basis for it. Instead it’s largely a made-up label, used to define and separate us. Of course, just because race is made up doesn’t make it any less powerful. To a disturbing extent, race still determines people’s perceptions, their opportunities, and their experiences. Genetic sequencing, which has allowed researchers to trace the path of human migration and now allows individuals to trace their own ancestry, has introduced new ways of thinking about human diversity.

Even though numerous animal species shed tears, emotional crying is a uniquely human activity. Regardless of the reason behind it, many people believe that expressing one’s emotions in this way can be both cathartic and healthy. In Japan, entrepreneur Hiroki Terai has even adopted this belief as a business strategy. He is the founder of a group crying service that encourages people to cry together while a “handsome weeping boy” wipes their tears away. Known as rui-katsu or 'tear-seeking,’ the practice is especially popular with women and is said to relieve stress levels.

The series tells the story of the life, work, murder and legacy of gorilla researcher Dian Fossey. The series will weave together three story strands. The first is the story of Dian's life and work - her childhood, her early days researching in Congo and her arrival in Rwanda for the 18 years she studied Mountain Gorillas. The second strand covers Dian's murder in Rwanda and the trial of her American co-worker Wayne McGuire, who was found guilty of her murder. Wayne fled Rwanda before the trial began but was convicted in absentia. He has always maintained his innocence. We intend to reopen the case by reviewing the evidence (if it can be located) and speaking with people who knew and worked with Dian and were involved in investigating the murder. Finally, we will tell the story of Dian's legacy by filming the Pablo troop of gorillas, which includes the silverback Cantsbee, the most successful gorilla ever known. The series will use archive footage and still images, interviews with people who knew and worked with Dian, specially shot footage and reconstruction to tell the life story of Dian Fossey and the aftermath of her murder.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Since the skull is in good condition, they can be almost certain of the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth. They hope this technology will provide researchers with clues to solve Biblical mysteries. \n\nRead more about the facial reconstruction: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/09/mary-magdalene-face-skull-france-video-spd/\n\nIs This the Face of Mary Magdalene? | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/vBZ2I0hcb9I\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-09-24T15:00:05.000Z"},{"id":"N4k8ywNKgo4","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/N4k8ywNKgo4/0.jpg","title":"Get a First Look Inside a Newly Opened Egyptian Tomb | National Geographic","description":"Archaeologists explored for the first time a 3,500-year-old tomb near Luxor, Egypt.

The clay text may demonstrate that this civilization built its monuments and canals with a higher degree of mathematical understanding than historians had thought. Discovered sometime about a century ago, scholars of ancient mathematics have been studying it for decades. New findings by Daniel Mansfield and Norman Wildberger of the University of New South Wales, Sydney reveal that the text may have been a complete table of trigonometry. If that’s true, it would be by far the oldest ever discovered. Until now, a Greek trig table from about 120 B.C. was considered the first. Plimpton 322 predates that by more than a thousand years.\n\nREAD: Ancient Tablet May Show Earliest Use of This Advanced Math\n\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/08/ancient-babylonian-trigonometry-tablet-plimpton-322-video-spd/\n\nSolving an Ancient Tablet's Mathematical Mystery | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/-sajLDiqIZE\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-09-03T17:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"T8cDiTRTSG8","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/T8cDiTRTSG8/0.jpg","title":"See How Chainsaw Art Keeps This Guy Out of Trouble | Short Film Showcase","description":"Lumberjack Steve Backus is not your average artist.

Their overpopulation threatens the well-being of these felines, leaving them susceptible to disease, neglect and starvation. However, one resident has made it her mission to look after Jerusalem's strays and to give them the best life possible. Tova Saul has devoted an enormous amount of time and money to feed and rescue stray cats. In 2016 alone, she spent close to $15,000 USD to trap, spay, and release 76 cats, rescue and place 48 kittens in homes, and provide medical care for 28 sick cats and kittens. As an observant Jew and animal lover, she is driven by a duty to stop the suffering of all animals, a concept she feels is not entirely observed by others of her faith. Follow Saul as she ventures throughout the city, including Jewish and Muslim neighborhoods, to feed cats and trap them for spaying and to educate curious onlookers of all religions. \n\nLearn more about Tova Saul's work in Jerusalem.\nhttps://holylandcats.wordpress.com/\n\nRead the article, \"Vasectomies Could Cut Feral Cat Population.\"\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130820-feral-cats-vasectomy-animals-science-pets-nation/\n\nHoly Cats!

He was raised in Huanchaco, Peru, a city built on the foundations of ancient structures. It’s been continually occupied for more than 3,500 years and home to the Moche, Chimú, and Inca cultures. Today, the cultural continuity is most apparent when fishermen pull up onshore in their reed boats and clean their fish. The reed boats were used by Peruvian fisherman thousands of years ago and are still used today. Inspired by the sense of cultural continuity around him, Prieto decided to devote his life to the study of ancient cultures and artifacts. He moved to the United States and earned a Ph.D. from Yale University specializing in archaeology. He returned home and is now a professor at the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, realizing his vision of involving local people from Huanchaco in archaeological projects in the area. “The best way to get people involved and to learn about their own past is to give them the opportunity to work in the sites,” Prieto said. \n\nPrieto and his students discovered a small but significant archaeological site at Pampas Gramalote, a fishing village near Huanchaco dating between 2000 and 1200 B.C. They unearthed a temple that was used by fishermen who hunted sharks over 3,000 years ago. It is the oldest archaeological settlement known in the area, providing a direct link between the contemporary coastal communities and their ancestors living in traditional fishing villages. Prieto and his students found children’s bodies in the temple, the positions of their bodies suggesting the children were sacrificed. He believes a few of the fishermen living in the village performed religious rituals at the temple site. Prior to the discovery of the temple, archaeologists believed that the ancient shark hunters were making religious offerings away from the village in a nearby valley. \n\nIn a town where traditional fishermen and women live side by side with commuters to nearby Trujillo and ancient burial sites lay across the street from the beachside hotels, time is relative. Though Prieto dedicates himself to preserving the history around him, he is a man constantly looking toward the future. He dreams of one day creating an archaeological park in his hometown to attract visitors and invest the local population in protecting their cultural heritage. \n\nGlobalXplorer° is a cutting-edge platform that empowers citizen scientists around the world to help reduce looting and encroachment at important archaeological sites—as well as discover and protect unknown sites—using satellite imagery.

His “continental displacement” theory suggested that the earth’s continents once formed a single land mass that had gradually drifted apart over time. Wegener was largely disregarded by the geoscientific community until 1953, when a young cartographer named Marie Tharp began charting ocean floor depth measurements. In partnership with geologist Bruce Heezen, Tharp’s detailed maps of the ocean floor revealed rifts and valleys that supported Wegener’s controversial theory. Initially dismissed as “girl talk,” Tharp and Heezen finally brought the concept of plate tectonics to the mainstream in 1968 when they published their ocean floor map in National Geographic Magazine. Cementing her place in history, Tharp was awarded the National Geographic Society’s Hubbard Medal in 1978 for her pioneering research. \n\nThis animation by Rosanna Wan for the Royal Institution tells the fascinating story of Marie Tharp’s groundbreaking work to help prove Wegener’s theory. \n\nRosanna Wan - http://www.rosanna-wan.com/\nRoyal Institution - https://www.youtube.com/user/theroyalinstitution\n\nHow One Brilliant Woman Mapped the Secrets of the Ocean Floor | Short Film Showcase\nhttps://youtu.be/vE2FK0B7gPo\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-02-12T18:00:05.000Z"},{"id":"S1ZvDRxZlb0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/S1ZvDRxZlb0/0.jpg","title":"Third Gender: An Entrancing Look at Mexico's Muxes | Short Film Showcase","description":"In Mexico’s southern state of Oaxaca, indigenous communities accept a third category of gender besides just male and female.

In Uganda, widowed women can suffer a multitude of injustices: They can be forced out of their homes, robbed of everything they own, made to marry a brother-in-law, physically attacked or harmed—even their children can be taken away from them. These offenses stem from traditional Buganda culture, where women would never be able to own or inherit land. And while the Ugandan Constitution grants equal rights to men and women, people in rural areas continue to take advantage of these women with little fear of consequences. \n\nThis is the story of Betty Nanozi, who was widowed just three weeks after her son, John Paul, was born. Over the 11 years of her widowhood, she describes how her husband’s children from a previous marriage (all adults) robbed her of everything twice, even threatening the life of her son (their half brother.) Now, with the help of attorneys, social workers, and criminal investigators from the International Justice Mission, Nanozi is fighting back. \n\nThis video was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. As of January 2017, the alleged perpetrators, including the leader, Wasaja, have yet to be convicted, and the case is still ongoing. \n\nRead more about what life is like for widows in Uganda, India, and Bosnia and Herzegovina in the magazine feature story: For Widows, Life After Loss\nhttp://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/02/global-images-of-widows-india-bosnia-uganda-discrimination-exile/\n\nThis Widow’s Relatives Stole Everything.

With fewer guns than the soldiers they were battling, many slaves fought with the machetes they had used to toil the sugarcane fields. In this short film from Third Horizon, Avril shares his mysterious craft as well as the practical and spiritual value of the machete throughout Haitian history. \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Get More Short Film Showcase: http://bit.ly/ShortFilmShowcase\n\nAbout Short Film Showcase:\nThe Short Film Showcase spotlights exceptional short videos created by filmmakers from around the web and selected by National Geographic editors.

She aspires to compete in the 2020 Olympics. A devout Muslim, Zafar announced at six that she wanted to wear a hijab, but she is not allowed to compete in one. She has spoken with local officials, USA Boxing, and the International Boxing Association to obtain a waiver so she can wear her hijab and clothing under her jersey. In the meantime she still trains every night as if she will compete. \n\nHer story is part of the National Geographic article titled \"Changing Girlhood,\" which focuses on girls growing up in America and the messages they receive from various forms of media as they transition into young women. \n\nUPDATE: May 3, 2017 \n\nIn April, USA Boxing issued a waiver to Zafar to allow her to fight in local matches and she was finally able to get in the ring on Saturday, April 29th. Despite losing the match in a split decision, Zafar, her opponent, and their coaches shared a group hug, nodding to the importance of the occasion. USA Boxing said in a statement that they are currently amending their domestic competition rules to accommodate boxers' religions. For now, they say they will consider exemptions on an individual basis as per their policy for non-advancing domestic competitions. For Zafar to fulfill her dream of boxing in the 2020 Olympics, she'd still need an international waiver from AIBA, boxing's international governing body. \n\nVIDEO: Kitra Cahana  \nEDITOR: Gabrielle Ewing  \nTRANSCRIPTIONS: Fletcher Reveley\n\nThis Teen Boxer Wants A Chance to Compete Wearing Her Hijab | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/LAS2R4axS-Y\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-01-01T16:00:04.000Z"},{"id":"V5r3T6RmfTk","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/V5r3T6RmfTk/0.jpg","title":"\"Where Love Is Illegal\": Chronicling LGBT Stories of Love and Discrimination (Part 1) | Nat Geo Live","description":"While 780 million people live in countries where same-sex relationships are legal, 2.8 billion people live where consensual same-sex acts are a crime.

For nearly 75 years, hundreds who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor remained buried in graves marked \"Unknown.\" Many of their parents, spouses, and children have passed away without the closure of burying them at home. \n\nAmong the casualties was United States Navy Ensign John Charles England, who served aboard the U.S.S. Oklahoma, one of the first ships attacked. After surviving the first strike, Ensign England led three men to safety. The fourth time he returned to the capsizing ship, he never resurfaced. His last letter home a few weeks before the attack talked of his newborn daughter and how much he was looking forward to meeting her. England never had the chance to meet his daughter and died a week before his 21st birthday. But his granddaughter, Bethany Glenn, became interested in his story decades later. 429 men died on the U.S.S. Oklahoma, second in casualties to the U.S.S. Arizona; 388 of those men on the U.S.S. Oklahoma were \"unaccounted for.\" \n\nGlenn learned that her grandfather's remains, along with those of 27 other men, were partially identified in the 1940s. She became part of a group of families, led by Pearl Harbor survivor Ray Emory and Bob Valley, advocating for their return. In 2015, the Department of Defense's POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) began disinterring unknowns from the U.S.S. Oklahoma, using DNA and other records to begin positive identification. Remains are now being flown to burials arranged by the men's surviving families. John England's remains were among the first to return home and were buried with full military honors. There are more than 83,000 U.S. service members currently classified as missing in action or prisoners of war. While the DPAA states less than half are likely to be resolved, it has set a five-year goal for the identification of all of the U.S.S. Oklahoma unknowns. Those currently in military service now give DNA samples when they enlist, aiding in making the unknown soldier a pain of the past. \n\nFor more information, read \"Hero Lost at Pearl Harbor Comes Home After Years in an Unknown Grave\" : http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/11/pearl-harbor-unknown-soldier-dna-identification/\n\nPRODUCER/CAMERA/EDIT: Gabriella Garcia-Pardo\nCOLORIST: Raul Marrero\nGRAPHICS: Hai-Lam Phan\nPRODUCTION ASSITANCE: Amber Seyler\nADDITIONAL FOOTAGE: Defense Video Imagery Distribution System\nMUSIC: Cool Cat Music, Anthony Brown, Sergei Stern, Chris Haigh, Benjamin Steele\n\nPearl Harbor Hero Returns Home After 75 Years in an Unknown Grave | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/_at4HmHIvAk\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-11-11T13:00:03.000Z"},{"id":"aaPWAE34GJU","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/aaPWAE34GJU/0.jpg","title":"Bird-Watching While Black: A Wildlife Ecologist Shares His Tips | Short Film Showcase","description":"J.

As the slab of marble was removed, revealing the Holy Bed, conservationists were surprised to discover something their instruments hadn’t detected: a layer of debris beneath the marble cover. They will analyze the debris to learn more about the ancient resting place. \n\nLocated in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem, the tomb has been covered by marble cladding since at least A.D. 1555, and most likely centuries earlier. The modest tomb has never before been photographed, and no drawings exist. This is the first time anyone alive today has seen the Holy Bed. \n\nThis burial shelf is now enclosed by a small structure known as the Edicule (from the Latin aedicule, or \"little house\"), which was last reconstructed in 1808-1810 after being destroyed in a fire. The Edicule and the interior tomb are currently undergoing restoration by a team of scientists from the National Technical University of Athens under the direction of Chief Scientific Supervisor Professor Antonia Moropoulou. \n\nThe National Geographic Society, with the blessing of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem and other religious communities, formed a strategic alliance with the National Technical University of Athens for cultural heritage preservation. For an exclusive look at the restoration project, watch Explorer on National Geographic Channel, coming in November. \n\nRead more: Exclusive: Christ's Burial Place Exposed for First Time in Centuries\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/jesus-tomb-opened-church-holy-sepulchre/\n\nEXCLUSIVE: A Closer Look Inside Christ's Unsealed Tomb | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/nkmx_k9wVs0\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-10-30T23:00:01.000Z"},{"id":"v0mInLBgdKM","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/v0mInLBgdKM/0.jpg","title":"Learning the Art of Traditional Tattooing on the Cook Islands | Short Film Showcase","description":"Englishman Croc Coulter lives in Rarotonga, the largest of the Cook Islands in the Pacific Ocean.

As a girl Nazreen struggled with her society's expectations of how a woman should act and behave, which drove her as a young woman to enter the nonprofit world and work to empower women. Eventually Nazreen conceived of the idea to combine her passion for mountain climbing and her passion for helping women into one mission— summiting the seven summits, symbolic of the everyday struggles Bangladeshi women face in society. Nazreen takes the stage to share the challenges she has faced as a woman in Bangladesh, her passion for mountain climbing, and her efforts to empower women in Bangladesh and around the world.\n \nUpcoming Events at National Geographic Live\nhttp://events.nationalgeographic.com/events/\n \nMore about Wasfia's organization\nhttp://www.oselfoundation.org/\n \nPRODUCER: Hilary Hudson\nEDITOR: Adam Lee\nTECHNICAL DIRECTOR: John McDonald\nSERIES PRODUCER: Chris Mattle\n\nShe Summited Each Continent’s Highest Mountain To Empower Women | Nat Geo Live\nhttps://youtu.be/YbIyLQ-C5Yw\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-10-16T15:00:01.000Z"},{"id":"9SobJftnGJU","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/9SobJftnGJU/0.jpg","title":"Exclusive: Is This the Skull of Slave Rebellion Leader Nat Turner? | National Geographic","description":"Is this Nat Turner's skull? The legacy of Nat Turner continues to be rewritten. An enslaved African-American preacher, he led a small army of slaves to kill 55 white Virginians beginning on August 21, 1831. The rebellion was quickly suppressed, and Turner went into hiding. He was captured just over two months later, tried, and sentenced to death. It's rumored that, in an attempt to crush his legacy, his body was decapitated and pieces of his tanned skin were given out as souvenirs. For the past decade, what's believed to be Turner's skull has been in the possession of Richard Hatcher, former mayor of Gary, Indiana. Recently, he turned it over to Turner's fourth-generation descendants, who have enlisted forensic experts for testing.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

These towns and their self-reliant middle class and affluent residents are documented by the home movies of Reverend S. S. Jones, an itinerant minister and businessman. Known and respected by the citizens of the towns whose lives he captured on film, Rev. Jones’s work offers revealing glimpses of these communities as a haven for African Americans who very often faced discrimination elsewhere in America. The subjects are everyday life: a family on the front porch of their bungalow, shop workers at a storefront, farmers plowing their fields, children playing on seesaws in a schoolyard. Much of the material documents the economic life of the towns, from business districts filled with prosperous merchants to the homes of successful professionals, with an abundant countryside beyond. As Rhea Combs, curator of film and photography for the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, points out in her commentary, here we even find a married couple who were oil barons, proof of the extraordinary progress made in the relatively short time since the end of slavery. The fashions and hairstyles, automobiles and horses, and even such details as a man manually pumping gasoline at a filling station make the films a fascinating record of the lives of Americans, and African Americans in particular, in the early 20th century.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Although it shares many of the proportions of larger horses, the breed stands at a mere 100 to 110 cm (3.2to 3.6 ft). Some legends connect the small but mighty Skyrian horse with those that Achilles took to Troy, while other theories link the breed to the small horses that appear on the frieze of the Parthenon temple in Athens. There is no concrete proof for these claims, but evidence suggests that the breed has survived relatively isolated in Greece for several thousand years. \n\nDue to declining use of horsepower, overgrazing of livestock on Skyros, and interbreeding with donkeys on the island, the number of Skyrian horses has decreased. Only about 300 horses are left. To preserve the rare breed, organizations such as the Skyros Island Horse Trustare working to increase the population and encourage locals to protect the horses. The hope is to increase the genetic pool of Skyrian horses on the island to prevent their numbers from dwindling.\n\nClick to read more about these horses: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/skyros-ponies-horses-rare-breed/\n\nPRODUCER/EDITOR: Iliana Mier Lavin\n\nMusic: Yan Perchuk\n\nTiny but Mighty: This Ancient Greek Horse Still Exists Today | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/YbcxU1IK7s4\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-09-30T16:00:04.000Z"},{"id":"pGpNBrix7Hk","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/pGpNBrix7Hk/0.jpg","title":"Greek And Roman Statues Were Once Colorfully Painted | National Geographic","description":"Greek and Roman statues haven't always had that glazed look in their eyes—many were once painted.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

In 2014, a young Senegalese man named Assan Baldé crossed the most deadly route, from Libya, and was sent to Camini’s budding refugee program. There he found a second home and a second family with Cosmano Fonte.\n\nFonte and Baldé, along with several other immigrants and natives of Camini, are restoring abandoned houses in order to provide new homes for arriving refugees. Their friendship is emblematic of the village’s reception to the immigrants. Refugees and locals live as neighbors and friends and have shaped a community of people who support one another like family regardless of race or religion. The town’s refugee program, Eurocoop, has brought the refugees together with the people who have lived in Camini their entire lives, offering courses ranging from Italian language to pastamaking. For Fonte, the program is the town’s hope: “Thanks to this emergency that has reached Camini, little by little, things in the village are changing.”\n\nFor more about the New Europe, including interviews with refugees and immigrants, read the story from the October issue of National Geographic Magazine.\nhttp://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/10/europe-immigration-muslim-refugees-portraits/\n\nThis Italian Village Was Dying … Until the Refugees Came | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/X4v51rNRUME\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-09-25T16:00:04.000Z"},{"id":"NDcBhIEwa3U","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/NDcBhIEwa3U/0.jpg","title":"Official Teaser | Killing Reagan","description":"Movie Event Sunday Oct 16 8/7c.

The services available were ill-advised: One man, Mahammad, sought care for an eye injury from a doctor who was actually a quack. Eventually, due to years of improper eye care, he became blinded for life. In this rural setting, blindness can be especially isolating. Fearing for her safety, Nasra never leaves her home alone. Mahammad requires assistance with everyday tasks.\n\nOphthalmologist Asim Sil organized a network of medical workers to examine people in the Sundarbans and transport them by bus or by boat to care centers and a hospital. His plan is to expand the network’s reach even further and help connect the blind not just to the outside world but also to their own communities.\n\nWatch: Inside an Inspiring School in India That Prepares Blind Youth for Life \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4iemazYidE\n\nWatch: Two Blind Sisters See For the First Time\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EltIpB4EtYU\n\nBringing Life-Changing Treatments to the Blind in India | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/WmqVzDqewho\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-08-26T12:00:02.000Z"},{"id":"1gWJdnU1tTE","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/1gWJdnU1tTE/0.jpg","title":"Escobar's Teenage Assassins | Facing Escobar","description":"The DEA is surprised to learn that charismatic Pablo Escobar is recruiting teenagers and turning them into assassins for his drug empire.  \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.
