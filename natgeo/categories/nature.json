A veterinary team rescued the whale, and attempted to treat the malnourished mammal. The whale regurgitated several plastic bags, but died on June 1.\n\nOver 17 pounds of plastic waste were removed from the whale’s stomach during a necropsy, including more than 80 plastic bags and other debris. The whale had starved, because the plastic waste prevented it from eating food. \n\n18 billion pounds of plastics end up in the world’s oceans every year. Avoiding single-use plastics like shopping bags and straws can help reduce the plastics mistakenly ingested by animals.\n\nRead more in \"How This Whale Got Nearly 20 Pounds of Plastic in Its Stomach\" \nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/06/whale-dead-plastic-bags-thailand-animals/\n\n17 Pounds of Plastic Waste Kills Pilot Whale | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/RNVO12C2p6Y\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-06-05T17:00:01.000Z"},{"id":"ld-2tUCmevw","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/ld-2tUCmevw/0.jpg","title":"His House Survived a Devastating Wildfire.

Once the ground team moves in safely, their first objective is to make sure the creature is stable before carefully drilling a hole into the back of its horn. This area of a rhinos' horn is comprised of dead cells, which means the animal will not feel any pain during the procedure. A radio transmitter is then inserted into the opening, and dental acrylic and paint are used to conceal the device so it matches the rest of the horn.

From his early childhood years to his final hours at age 91, Picasso was devoted to mastering his deeply personal art. He’s considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, and his work is studied for its meaning and celebrated for its creativity. Nearly half a century after his death, Picasso continues to bewitch, confuse, entice, and provoke.

In southeast Turkey’s Batman province, 19-year-old Rüzgar Alkan came upon the squirrel with its front legs caught in an animal trap. Alkan brought it to a vet in the province’s capital., but the injuries were too serious to treat there. Research led Alkan to Tayfun Demir, already caregiver to a rescue squirrel. Demir agreed to adopt Karamel, too, and the squirrel came to live with him in Istanbul, about 700 miles away. At Istanbul Aydın University, orthotist Mustafa Gültekin, with orthopedist Tolgay Şatana, and physical therapist Eylem Küçük all worked to help Karamel recover. Karamel underwent two surgeries, one lasting six hours. Saving Karamel’s legs became impossible due to gangrene. But a specially constructed prosthesis allowed Karamel to be outfitted with wheels.

Once a major coal mining center, the economy here now centers on cat tourism. When mining stopped in early 1990s, Houtong’s population plummeted. But the cat-to-human ratio surged, as some relocated without their pets. Others who remained kept feeding the strays. After a visit to Houtong in 2007, Jian Peiling, aka “Mrs. Kitty,” now a pro cat photographer, organized a volunteer welfare campaign for the felines. There have been unhappy moments. People have stolen cats and abandoned them at Cat Village. Introduced animals raise disease risk. Houtong’s cats do receive vaccinations. And they're all fixed, so a stable cat population reflects an illicit influx. Estimates vary: 100 to 200 cats—equal to or double the human population. Two-legged guests are very welcome. In 2009, Houtong's train station had over a quarter million arrivals—already a tenfold increase over the previous decade. But last year, visits may have topped one million.\n\nVideo: 28Lab / Kei Oumawatari via Caters News\nAdditional images: GoranQ; Nuttapol Puntavachirapan; Sanjin Wang via Getty Images, Xcatx Cai\n\nRead more in \"Look Inside Taiwan's 'Cat Village'\" here:\nhttps://on.natgeo.com/2H92euL\n\nHow Cats Revived this Ex-Coal Town's Economy | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/I135uBe4HK4\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-04-16T17:00:02.000Z"},{"id":"8rTEe2vS-VI","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/8rTEe2vS-VI/0.jpg","title":"Spiders Spin Balloons to Fly Away | National Geographic","description":"This crab spider is surveying the wind condition with its leg hairs … to take flight.  \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

The place’s name, Dujiangyan, meaning \"dam on the capital city’s river\" is a modest title for an undertaking of incredible scope. The great rivers of China helped the civilization flourish, but also brought devastation during years of severe flooding. In the third century B.C., Li Bing, serving the ruling Qin state, devised this system of weir works—levees, partial dams, and waterways—to regulate the flow of the Min River, the largest tributary of the Yangtze. Upriver from the Chengdu Plain rise the high Longmenshan—Dragon’s Gate Mountains. In springtime, meltwater pours down.

Due to changes in climate and other factors, the recent outbreak of these destructive insects has reached proportions never before seen in recorded history. Alarming estimates from the U.S. Forest Service state that 100,000 beetle-infested trees fall daily across the United States.\n\nTo combat this epidemic, Professor Diana Six has made it her mission to crack the genetic code of the pine tree. She hopes that studying the relationship between the mountain pine beetle and the trees they kill will provide us with valuable insight into the future of our forests. In this short film made at the International Wildlife Film Festival Filmmaker Labs, Professor Six walks among the trees and shares her thoughts on why humans can do more to counteract the effects of climate change. \n\nMade at International Wildlife Film Festival Filmmaker Labs: https://wildlifefilms.org/filmmaker-labs\n\nProfessor Diana Six: http://cfc.umt.edu/research/sixlab/\n\nMusic: \n    New West Studios\n    http://www.newweststudios.com\n\nArt: \n    Eric Linton\n    https://www.lintonartdesigns.com\n\nA Special Thanks To: \n    University of Montana\n    http://www.umt.edu\n\n    WWF\n    https://www.worldwildlife.org\n\n    Canon USA, Inc.\n    https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home\n\n    Days Edge\n    http://www.daysedge.com\n\nGenerously funded by: \n    WWF\n    https://www.worldwildlife.org\n\n    Tangled Bank Studios\n    https://www.tangledbankstudios.org\n\nA film by: \n    Chris O’Flaherty\n    http://www.oflahertyphoto.com\n    http://www.vimeo.com/cjoflair\n\n    Todd Amacker\n    http://www.toddamacker.com\n    https://www.instagram.com/toddamacker\n\n    Shireen Rahimi\n    http://www.shireenrahimi.com\n\n    Olivia Schmidt\n    http://www.oliviagrace.co\n    https://www.instagram.com/olivia.grace.photo\n\n    Tim Treuer\n    http://www.treuer.tumblr.com\n    https://www.instagram.com/ttreuer\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

The more familiar auroras, also called Northern and Southern Lights are diffuse, and often mainly green or yellow, sometimes with a purple or pink fringe. Amateur sky watchers brought the east-west oriented streaks to the attention of physicists. \"Steve\" was a placeholder name, but stuck, later becoming official, standing for Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement. Normal auroras follow a cascade of events: charged solar particles hit Earth’s magnetic field, ultimately causing atoms high in the atmosphere to glow. A STEVE happens when plasma—charged, hot particles—flow along the magnetic field’s lines. STEVEs occur about 100 miles up, 40 miles higher than regular auroras, and are visible beyond the better-known lights’ viewing range. Green bands sometimes seem to shoot out from the purple trunk, much lower in the atmosphere than the main streak. Their cause is unknown. And exactly how do streams of ions become a glowing, purple STEVE? That’s also a mystery.\n\nPurple Streak Named 'Steve' Is a Whole New Type of Aurora | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/slM_VBTnKn8\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-03-20T23:00:05.000Z"},{"id":"uns8vUQNxpc","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/uns8vUQNxpc/0.jpg","title":"Pythons 101 | National Geographic","description":"From unbelievably flexible jaws to rows of razor sharp teeth, a range of impressive features make the python one of nature's most formidable predators.Learn about ball, burmese, reticulated, and other types of pythons, what the snakes eat, where they live, and how a surprising feature might be a sign of legged ancestors.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

At rehab center the Rhino Orphanage, Lottie is special, but not unique. The center raises rhinos with mothers lost to poaching so they may grow to survive in the wild. Lottie soon settled in, showing vigor. The staff wanted Lottie to meet another recent arrival, five-month-old Mofalodi, or Lolli.

But the camouflage can’t work without snow. And length of daylight, not snowfall, triggers molting. Scott Mills and colleagues at the University of Montana study snowshoe hares from a population in Washington state, where some change color seasonally, and others stay brown all year—better if there’s less snow. The research shows that regions where genes for winter-white and winter-brown coats coexist allow natural selection for new, less snowy conditions. The scientists recommend protecting habitat in these evolutionary hotspots. \n\nREAD: How Color-Changing Animals Are Rebelling Against Climate Change\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/animals-climate-change-winter-evolution\n\nWill Snowshoe Hares Win a Race Between Evolution and Climate Change? | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/NwZzmTuhs3M\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-02-26T18:00:03.000Z"},{"id":"jEhdNWKDtk4","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/jEhdNWKDtk4/0.jpg","title":"Creepy Yet Heartwarming: Centipede Mother \"Hugs\" Its Babies | National Geographic","description":"Nothing is more heartwarming than a mother caring for her young—even when it's a 6-inch-long centipede.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Termite-hunting ants abide by a similar code. A new study reveals that after a raid on a termite nest, the injured ants are cared for by their comrades. If kept by themselves, 80 percent of injured ants died. But if cared for by their nest-mates for even an hour, only a tenth died. Another finding of the study reveals how the ants prioritize who gets cared for and who doesn’t. In human health care, doctors decide which patients need to be helped the most. With ants, it’s the exact opposite. The injured ants themselves decide if they should be treated or not. When no help was in sight, injured ants made a beeline for the nest. But when nest-mates were near, they stumbled and fell, appearing “more injured” as a way to attract aid. But the ants play up their injuries only if they sensed that their problems were minor enough to be treated. If ants were mortally injured, they refused to cooperate, flailing their legs around when probed or picked up, forcing their helpers to abandon them. The mortally wounded ants choose to die rather than have energy and resources wasted on their futile rehabilitation. This discovery marks the first time non-human animals have been observed systematically nursing their wounded back to health.\n\nRead more in \"'Paramedic' Ants Are the First to Rescue and Heal Their Wounded Comrades\"\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/matabele-ants-rescue-heal-injured-soldiers/\n\nSelf-Sacrificing Ants Refuse Treatment of Their Wounds | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/MVTj_gyZdY0\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-02-20T18:00:01.000Z"},{"id":"bP-IEhXGjY0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/bP-IEhXGjY0/0.jpg","title":"This Fish \"Walks\" Like Our Prehistoric Ancestors | National Geographic","description":"This animal, called a “little skate,” may be providing us clues to the evolutionary development of land-dwelling locomotive behavior.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

We didn’t know just how similar it was … until now. Most land-dwelling vertebrates use walking as their primary method of getting around. The neural circuits essential for walking are different than the neural circuits most fish use for swimming. With swimming, locomotion is driven by muscles around the spine. With walking, locomotion is driven by acute control of muscles in the limbs. Recent genetic analysis reveals that the little skate carries the same gene as four-legged animals. This discovery helps paint a clearer picture of the origins of land-dwelling creatures.\n\nRead more in \"What This Walking Fish Can Teach Us About Evolution\"\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/skate-neural-genetics-walking-human-evolution-spd/\n\nThis Fish \"Walks\" Like Our Prehistoric Ancestors | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/bP-IEhXGjY0\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-02-20T13:00:04.000Z"},{"id":"yQeNHT0jgvY","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/yQeNHT0jgvY/0.jpg","title":"Nearly 150,000 Orangutans Lost to Logging, Palm Oil, and Human Conflict | National Geographic","description":"Nearly 150,000 orangutans vanished from Borneo over a 16-year period, a new study found. \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Scientists believe that skates are laying eggs on these vents for a reason. Hydrothermal vents are places where super-heated water erupts out of the sea floor, usually where tectonic plates meet. The water can exceed temperatures of 750° Fahrenheit, providing pockets of heat in an otherwise cold, deep-sea environment. In the cold waters of the deep sea, eggs take much longer to incubate. When eggs are placed near a hydrothermal vent, the heat speeds up the incubation process by months or years.\n\nRead more in \"This Deep-Sea Creature Lays Its Eggs on Hydrothermal Vents—A First\"\nhttp://bit.ly/2nOL9eB\n\nRare Video: Deep-Sea Creature Incubates Eggs on Hydrothermal Vents | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/LssEZLFuVnA\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-02-14T00:00:01.000Z"},{"id":"WKEu90Zsh4A","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/WKEu90Zsh4A/0.jpg","title":"Bombardier Beetles Squirt Boiling Anal Chemicals to Make Frogs Vomit | National Geographic","description":"Bombardier beetles are often unlucky snacks for frogs, but they have a tricky defense mechanism even after being eaten—make the frogs throw them back up. \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

In late July, 2015, they were traveling through Hinlopen Strait, west of the largest island, Spitsbergen—an impossible route some summers, when pack ice blocks passage. But that summer, ice was especially sparse, making hunting harder for polar bears. These apex predators favor waiting at the sea ice’s edge, striking seals as they approach. A few days earlier, the Wilkinson family had been farther north, near the ice. There, bears looked healthy. But the scene just after midnight on July 23 was desperate. Mother and cub were struggling, skin hanging loose. According to Jon Aars, of the Norwegian Polar Institute, the cub, seven or eight months old, was likely to die if its mother didn’t eat soon. She probably wasn’t lactating. Wilkinson saw the bear sniff the air, picking up something of interest. This thin female couldn’t attack a healthy, full-grown walrus. A carcass would solve their problem. If the walrus were weak or sick, predation might be an option. But that walrus was alive and well. The situation was unworkable. The search for food went on.\n\nRead more about the polar bear and walrus, \"Desperate for Food, Polar Bear Tests Walrus\"\nhttp://bit.ly/2E8kOCl\n\nMother Polar Bear, Desperate for Food, Tests Walrus | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/FAHA6M7xT5M\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-02-12T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"BL4dnvBytLA","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/BL4dnvBytLA/0.jpg","title":"Behind-the-Scenes: See How Elon Musk Celebrated the Falcon Heavy Launch | National Geographic","description":"This exclusive behind-the-scenes clip follows the SpaceX CEO and his team as they witness and celebrate the first launch of Falcon Heavy.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

The archipelago wears the scars of war openly. The last conflict, when Argentina invaded the islands it claims as the Malvinas in 1982, ended after a brief but intense engagement with the United Kingdom. Roughly 20,000 land mines have not been accounted for, burned-out helicopters mar the landscape, and the Royal Air Force still has an active airfield on East Falkland.\n\nToday the resiliency of nature is everywhere. The Falklands archipelago is a haven for more than a hundred bird species, many of them seabirds. Thirty-six percent of the global numbers of southern rockhopper penguins, for example, live here. But the extraordinary profusion of wildlife still faces man-made risks: pollution, degraded habitat, oil slicks, baited hooks dragged behind fishing vessels, and, notably, climate change.\n\nSee more of Nicklen’s breathtaking photography in the February 2018 National Geographic magazine article on the Falkland Islands: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/02/falkland-islands/\n\nAfter Years of War, Nature is Flourishing on These Tiny Islands | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/5XNtRG4zT6o\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-01-30T18:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"BwB7Dyh7mBo","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/BwB7Dyh7mBo/0.jpg","title":"Watch: Oil Tanker Spill Off China May Have Lasting Environmental Impacts | National Geographic","description":"On January 6, 2018 an oil tanker collided with a cargo ship in the East China Sea. \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

As temperatures rise due to climate change, more and more females are being born.

To learn about their biology, scientists attached sensors to narwhals. Monitors tracked heart rate, swimming strokes, and diving depth, in a resting state, during a dive just after \"escape,\" and later, in a normal dive. Suction cups on the sensors released, and they floated up for retrieval. Animal species tend to react to a threat in one of two ways: For some, stress raises the heart rate and activity level. Other species freeze up, and their heart rate lowers. Narwhals don't fit either pattern. When they're released from nets, narwhals' heart rate plummets, even as they speed away. So they burn through ready oxygen, pushing tissues' limits. Researchers fear low oxygen may hurt cognition, causing unsafe behaviors, and adding to the risk narwhals face from human presence.\n\nRead more: https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/narwhals-heart-freeze-human-disturbance-animals/\n\nHeart Monitors on Narwhals Reveal Dangers of Human Encounters | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/8HNH-o3vNGE\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-12-11T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"_JhaVNJb3ag","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/_JhaVNJb3ag/0.jpg","title":"Heart-Wrenching Video: Starving Polar Bear on Iceless Land | National Geographic","description":"This is what climate change looks like.

The series will use archive footage and still images, interviews with people who knew and worked with Dian, specially shot footage and reconstruction to tell the life story of Dian Fossey and the aftermath of her murder.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

At some destinations, local residents keep captive wildlife, taken illegally from the jungle, to offer visitors the chance to hold a sloth, an anteater, or a caiman as if they were stuffed animals. Tourists also have the chance to swim with river dolphins, which tour operators attract with bait. The practice encourages aggressive behavior, endangering the very object of visitors' admiration. All of these encounters are stressful for the animals and can pose health and safety risks to tourists. \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

He speculates the porpoise may have been buried to preserve the meat or for an unknown religious purpose.\n\nREAD: Medieval Porpoise Burial Puzzles Scientists\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/09/medieval-porpoise-bones-buried-guernsey-video-spd/\n\nSee the Mysterious Medieval Porpoise Bones Found by Archaeologists | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/v1mnf3xDCA0\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-09-25T20:00:02.000Z"},{"id":"FRlUJrEUn0Y","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/FRlUJrEUn0Y/0.jpg","title":"Official Film Trailer: JANE | National Geographic","description":"Drawing from never-before-seen footage that has been tucked away in the National Geographic archives, director Brett Morgen tells the story of JANE, a woman whose chimpanzee research revolutionized our understanding of the natural world.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

By 1973 the population of these great apes in the Virunga Mountains had fallen below 275, but thanks to extreme conservation measures like constant monitoring, intensive antipoaching efforts, and emergency veterinary interventions, there are now about 480.\n\nFossey was a polarizing figure, but as Jane Goodall, the chimpanzee expert, once said, “If Dian had not been there, probably there might have been no mountain gorillas in Rwanda today.”\n\nRead the entire September 2017 National Geographic magazine story on Dian Fossey, and later this year watch 'Dian Fossey: Secrets in the Mist', a three-hour series that tells the story of her life, work, murder, and legacy on the National Geographic Channel.\nhttp://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/09/gorillas-dian-fossey-saved-rwanda/\n\nSearching for Rwanda's Famed Mountain Gorillas | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/JJ6J-i8yJWA\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-09-25T12:00:01.000Z"},{"id":"7XJGO524WyM","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/7XJGO524WyM/0.jpg","title":"Elephant Poaching Forces This Community to Take Sides | National Geographic","description":"Ivory poachers are targeting the Baka of Cameroon because they know where to find elephants.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

But that has unfortunately made them appealing recruits for poachers, who use the Baka as guides. The endemic poverty of the Baka makes them easy targets for such work; poaching gangs usually offer a pittance to the Baka guides. While some Baka have been lured by the payout of poaching, others like Bokko André have been brought into the fold of the National Park system to work as eco-guards and rangers.

These masses of solidified fat, oil, and grease clog up a sewer like cholesterol in an artery. When the resulting mass attaches to sewer walls, it can take some serious shoveling, hacking, vacuuming, and flushing to dislodge.

He has shown some signs of his hawk ancestry including swooping down and picking up forest debris, which young hawks do while learning to catch prey.

National Geographic Editor in Chief Susan Goldberg interviewed him in Washington, D.C., as he prepared to address leaders at the World Bank.\n\nIn this candid and emotional interview, Damon discusses the world’s water crisis and how his nonprofit is trying to push the needle towards progress.

Yet nearly 950 million people still practice this public health hazard—a challenge augmented by population growth.

While recordings of frogs elicited no flight response, the cougars frantically escaped as soon as the human voices were played. This could have important effects on predator-prey relationships. Habitat loss and fragmentation is rising, which leads to decreased feeding time as more people cross their paths. After hearing humans, cougars reduced their feeding time on kills by about half. This causes a 36% increase in their kill rates in areas with high human activity, which further increases the chance of encountering humans.\n\nClick here to read Cougars Are Terrified of Human Chatter—And That's a Big Problem.\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/06/california-cougars-fear-human-voices-spd/\n\nFootage Courtest: Santa Cruz Puma Project\n\nClick here to read the study about cougars and human voices.\nhttp://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1857/20170433\n\nClick here to read more about the Santa Cruz Puma Project.\nhttp://santacruzpumas.org/\n\nListen: Cougars Are Terrified of Human Chatter | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/YsjfnguQo4U\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-06-26T20:00:03.000Z"},{"id":"I76lavqaoh8","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/I76lavqaoh8/0.jpg","title":"Watch: Man Removes 'World's Deadliest Snake' from Home | National Geographic","description":"A black mamba, considered to be one of the most deadliest snakes in the world, paid an unexpected visit to a home in Durban, South Africa.

Unfortunately, the kangaroo died before help arrived, but the rescuers were able to pull a tiny joey from the mother’s pouch. Still attached to his mother’s teat, the rescuers had to cut him loose to avoid injuring his mouth by pulling him off. Weighing about nine ounces and around a month old, the baby kangaroo’s chances of survival aren't great. The rescuers placed the joey in a make-shift pouch and brought him to an experienced carer in hopes he can grow up healthy and eventually be released back into the wild.\n\nRead more about this baby kangaroo rescue and what may have led to the mother's death.\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/05/kangaroo-joey-rescue-australia/\n\nSpecial thanks to Sherri, Unheard Voices\n\nWatch: Baby Kangaroo Rescued After His Mother Dies | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/P2BUDRzmFpM\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-05-16T17:00:02.000Z"},{"id":"TZPrk9IZ3Jw","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/TZPrk9IZ3Jw/0.jpg","title":"Once, This Island Had Just One Tree—Look at It Now | National Geographic","description":"In the middle of the Atlantic, the tallest peak of a small volcanic island is covered in lush greenery, by design.

After importing thousands of plants and animals, however, Hooker came to have second thoughts about the undertaking, which wound up threatening the island’s sparse native vegetation. Now, conservationists are working to save Ascension’s few endemic plants from extinction.\n\nRead more in \"Mysterious Island Experiment Could Help Us Colonize Other Planets\"\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/05/ascension-island-terraformed-biology-evolution-conservation/\n\nOnce, This Island Had Just One Tree—Look at It Now | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/TZPrk9IZ3Jw\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-05-16T12:00:02.000Z"},{"id":"h-zHlyGnbBQ","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/h-zHlyGnbBQ/0.jpg","title":"Watch: Cape Seal Collides With Kayaker | National Geographic","description":"If you're ever out kayaking and encounter a group of seals, you may be tempted to paddle closer to get a better look.

But that's what is happening at Vietnam's Can Gio Mangrove Biosphere Reserve. The welfare group Animals Asia has released this footage showing macaques walking across tight ropes, catching rings, and performing other tricks at the direction of their trainers. \nDogs have also been seen being forced to jump through flaming hula hoops.

The whales can grow up to the length of three school buses and require a lot of energy to accelerate in the water. They speed up to about 6.7 miles just before consuming the krill, and the act of opening their mouth slows them down to about 1.1 miles per hour. They then have to expend even more energy to get back up to speed. All of this energy spent may lead the whales to be picky eaters, if the mass of krill is too small they may swim through without opening their mouth to feed. \n\nRead more about the blue whales: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/blue-whale-krill-feeding-habits-drone-video/\n\nSee Blue Whales Lunge For Dinner in Beautiful Drone Footage | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/cbxSBDopVyw\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-04-25T20:00:06.000Z"},{"id":"uUCD19mEliU","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/uUCD19mEliU/0.jpg","title":"Would You Stay if Your Home Became a Desert? | National Geographic","description":"Watch how one herder's traditional way of life is threatened by sandstorms and drought.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

While tearing down forests is generally a bad thing, at the RSPB Forsinard Flows Nature Reserve it is essential to restoring one of the most important ecosystems on the planet. Peatland blanket bogs have been absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere for thousands of years. In this one area of Scotland, the peatlands store an estimated 400 million tons of CO2—which is more than double the amount of CO2 stored in all of the United Kingdom’s forests put together. \n\nBut in the 1980s, tree plantations began buying up the peatlands in order to grow timber. They planted millions of trees and drained the peatlands of water, causing the peat to break apart and release CO2 back into the atmosphere. It’s estimated that losing just 4 percent of the CO2 that is stored in this peatland would equal Scotland’s combined household and industrial carbon emissions. \n\nThough it will take decades for the peatlands to be fully restored, the team at Forsinard Flows Nature Reserve works year round to do just that. \n\nRead about the Scottish Moorlands in National Geographic magazine\n\nhttp://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/05/scotland-moors-highlands-conservation-land-management/\n\nHere, Cutting Down Millions of Trees is Actually a Good Thing | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/XCXM1jqX3gI\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-04-17T12:00:01.000Z"},{"id":"ym7x3ogGjO4","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/ym7x3ogGjO4/0.jpg","title":"The Fascinating Lives of Bleeding Heart Monkeys (Part 1) | Nat Geo Live","description":"Join Jeff Kerby and Vivek Venkataraman for a rare look at Ethiopia's bleeding heart monkey, the gelada.

Admassu Getaneh, a hired gun and former soldier, is here to make sure that no one steals or ruins the grass. If you want to protect the world’s only grass-eating monkey, saving the grass is a good start. But native vegetation is everything in the highlands. Slender, sturdy stalks get strung into thatch and used for roofs. Men braid grass into rope. Women and children tie blades, sheaths, and stems into brooms and torches. Grass gets stuffed into mattresses. Yet across the misty highlands, where about 80 percent of Ethiopians live, grasslands, meadows, thickets, moors, and swamps are deteriorating into rock and dead earth. The population is exploding. Farms sprawl across damp, rich land, displacing native plants that help the ground hold moisture. Erosion wipes out 1.5 billion tons of topsoil annually, pushing subsistence farmers to even more marginal ground. This pattern plays out across Ethiopia—almost everywhere, it seems, except here. In Guassa the grass is high and wavy, the torch lilies and giant lobelia left to grow for years. It’s not a park. Local villagers run this place. A complex communal system determines where livestock grazes, who cuts grass, and when. As a result this landscape one-sixth the size of Nairobi is among East Africa’s healthiest. Nearly a quarter of the country’s endemic mammal species live here. There are about two dozen of one of the world’s most endangered canids, the ginger-furred Ethiopian wolf. Guassa is a hot spot for klipspringers, civets, African wolves, and hyenas. And unlike elsewhere in Ethiopia, its 800 or so chattering geladas live much as they have for thousands of years. \n\nRead the entire article from National Geographic Magazine: http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/04/gelada-monkeys-grass-eating-guassa-ethiopia-bleeding-heart/\n\nProtect the Grass, Save the People (and the Monkeys) | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/w_XMqrsKXa0\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-04-10T15:00:07.000Z"},{"id":"_FTNZnAqyow","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/_FTNZnAqyow/0.jpg","title":"Too Much Sex Is Killing These Male Snakes | National Geographic","description":"Watch thousands of snakes mate - an act so strenuous that it shortens the lives of the males.

Male snakes wait another two to four weeks before eating so that they'll be ready when the females arrive. As a result, males can go up to 8 months without eating.

Around the ocean’s many seeps of methane gas live colonies of microbes that feed on the methane. The gas is a significant contributor to the greenhouse effect. Observing the interaction between the tiny life forms and their unusual food source adds to the understanding of natural climate factors.\n\nMarlow worked with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Alvin submersible team to study methane seeps and microbes, a project funded by the National Science Foundation.

Their lineage split off from all the world’s more familiar fish long, long ago—probably before they evolved a backbone, something hagfish still lack. Sometimes called “slime eels”—they are slimy, but they’re not eels—hagfish have changed surprisingly little in 300 million years. They make their home on the ocean floor, often very deep. They’re certainly not what Lissete Hermosilla and some friends and family were angling for on a recent fishing trip in the coastal town of Tirúa, Chile. But when they realized that the strange creature had gotten caught up in their fishing gear, they untangled it and set it down to identify. Hermosilla may have found the hagfish’s slime a little gross at first, but she was pleased to see that it made its twisting way back to the ocean.\n\nMeet One of the World's Weirdest Fish | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/Xz8uscQzPso\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-03-13T20:00:02.000Z"},{"id":"WxOlR-ILJ0c","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/WxOlR-ILJ0c/0.jpg","title":"Mooch of the Penguins: Juvenile Won't Stop Begging Parent for Food | National Geographic","description":"This recently fledged penguin chick won't quit begging its parent for food.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

They are the smallest vestige of a genus that millions of years ago stretched from South Africa to Spain and into India. Once among the most prominent primates—one species was the size of a gorilla—they were likely driven to extinction by climate changes, competition with more adaptable baboons, and our ancestors, who butchered them. Today all that remains of Theropithecus are geladas, which offer valuable, if imperfect, insight into the world inhabited by our predecessors. There is no other animal like them. Geladas’ most recognizable features are crimson patches of hairless skin on their chests. In females, this region changes color, and tiny sacs around its edge fill with fluid, often indicating that they are ready to mate. The pink on dominant males darkens to red. Other primates signal sexual readiness with their rumps, but these monkeys spend most of the day scooting on their rears, gorging. Most primates climb trees to eat fruit and leaves. Geladas use opposable thumbs to pluck grass blades and herbs. Like zebras, they mince food with their molars.\n\nGuassa researchers, from Ethiopia and abroad, have followed the minutiae of the daily life of almost 500 individuals. They monitor activity, study relationships, track births, and document deaths. Yet much about geladas remains unknown. After a revolt in Ethiopia ousted Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974, a civil war made fieldwork difficult. In the early 1990s uprisings drove out the ruling communist junta, the Derg, and scientists returned. Today it’s still not clear how many geladas are left. \n\nRead the entire article from the April 2017 issue of National Geographic Magazine.\nhttp://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/04/gelada-monkeys-grass-eating-guassa-ethiopia-bleeding-heart/\n\nSpend a Day With the World’s Only Grass-Eating Monkeys | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/hFHcXxaqMhg\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-03-13T12:00:04.000Z"},{"id":"-x1P9DTfI-E","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/-x1P9DTfI-E/0.jpg","title":"The Water of Lost Hills | Water & Power: A California Heist","description":"On his quest for more information regarding California water, Mark Arax travels to Lost Hills to speak to a local activist about the town’s water issues. \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\n\nAbout Water & Power: A California Heist:\nFrom Emmy Award winning filmmaker Marina Zenovich and Academy Award winner Alex Gibney, this is the story of how a handful of water barons gained control of California’s most precious resource.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Through their world-class scientists, photographers, journalists, and filmmakers, Nat Geo gets you closer to the stories that matter and past the edge of what's possible.\n\nThe relocation work depicted in this video is a partnership between the not-for-profit Endangered Wildlife Trust and African Parks Network, with funding provided in part by the National Geographic Society.\n\nNational Geographic caught up with Vincent, a National Geographic Big Cats Initiative grantee and conservation biologist, to learn more about his work as a big cat Cupid.\n\nQ. What’s the state of cheetah conservation in South Africa?\nA: South Africa is Africa's most developed country, so it's particularly difficult for cheetah to traverse the landscape. What we have done with our few remaining wildlife reserves is fenced them, so we have to swap individuals between these reserves to prevent inbreeding. And South Africa is the only country, worldwide, where we've actually seen an increase in wild cheetah numbers.\nOne of the most successful conservation operations in Africa is the non-profit African Parks Network (APN). They manage 10 large reserves in 7 countries across Africa, and they've created safe space for a myriad of species over 6,000,000 hectares of land.  So it's really great to be working with APN and reintroducing species into their reserves.\n\nQ: How do you match mates?\nA: I manage a studbook for [330] cheetah in 53 different reserves across the country as part of the EWT’s Carnivore Conservation Programme. I identify which cheetah are related to each other and prevent putting them onto the same reserves. It's \"human mediated gene flow,\" which is just conservationists driving cheetah to a new reserve.\n\nQ: What happens when you move them to the new reserve?\nA:  We put them in an enclosure called a \"boma\" for six weeks to three months, allowing them to realize what other large predators are present and it kills their homing instinct. As with any cat species, they have an instinct to go back to where they originally came from. \nThe favorite part of my job is getting to open the gate and let that animal go be a cheetah, watching it run off into the bush and have access to wide, open spaces again. \nWe carefully monitor them for a few weeks. If they're not hunting successfully, we'll drop an impala or warthog carcass to give them that little bit more energy to push them to hunt successfully. \n\nQ: As a scientist you need to be objective, but is there any sort of personal connection? \nA: When you work with these animals you develop a connection. I did the post-release monitoring for a cheetah who at first made silly decisions hunting species well out of her size range, walked silly routes into the middle of the lion territory. But in the process she learns. Eventually, she gave birth to her first litter and I saw that motherly instinct come out. And the very best moment is when you get that phone call from the reserve manger saying, \"Vincent, we've got four new cubs that were born to the cheetah that you brought in here six months ago.\" That is what really brings joy to my heart. \n\nThis interview has been edited for length and content. \n\nVisit Endangered Wildlife Trust and African Parks Network to learn more. \nhttp://www.ewt.org.za\nhttp://www.african-parks.org\n\nFor more on big cats, tune in to Big Cat Week, premiering Monday, Feb. 20, at 9/8c on Nat Geo WILD and learn more about the National Geographic Big Cats Initiative, a global initiative that supports scientists and conservationists working to save big cats in the wild. http://NatGeoBigCats.org\n\nLearn more about the science and exploration supported by the nonprofit National Geographic Society at http://natgeo.org/grants.\n\nSENIOR PRODUCER: Sarah Joseph\nPRODUCER/EDITOR: Nora Rappaport\n\nCheetah Matchmaking: Helping Big Cats Find A Mate | Expedition Raw\nhttps://youtu.be/QYCRCd1NKOQ\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-02-21T18:00:03.000Z"},{"id":"SV9y6ktC84k","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/SV9y6ktC84k/0.jpg","title":"Great White and Oceanic Whitetip Sharks: Photographing Top Ocean Predators  (Part 3) | Nat Geo Live","description":"Dive into the ocean depths with legendary underwater photojournalist and National Geographic explorer Brian Skerry as he shares recent photographs and stories about one of the most fascinating and threatened creatures on the planet: the shark.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Get More Nat Geo Live: http://bit.ly/MoreNatGeoLive\n➡ Watch Part 1: https://youtu.be/iDjofTR5eX0\n➡ Watch Part 2: https://youtu.be/325ZxcLNs8w\n\nAbout Nat Geo Live (National Geographic Live):\nThe National Geographic Live series brings thought-provoking presentations by today’s leading explorers, scientists, photographers, and performing artists right to you.

Their meat and scales are in high demand for their supposed health benefits, and as a result the pangolin's population has plummeted. It's estimated that in the last 10 years, a million pangolins have been trafficked. Earlier this year, 4.4 tons of pangolin scales, labeled as plastic, were seized in Hong Kong, a haul estimated to represent between 1,100 and 6,600 pangolins and be worth $1.25 million (U.S.). Pangolins are now one of the most valuable animals to need protection, and bans are being discussed alongside those of iconic animals like elephants and rhinos. This short film produced by Coral and Oak Studios follows the regrettable voyage a pangolin takes from the moment it is caught to the moment it is consumed.

Researchers from the Marine Megafauna Foundation are investigating this mystery, as well as learning more about the endangered whale shark, since knowledge on them is very limited. \n\nRead related article by Alexandra Petri: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/01/whale-sharks-mafia-island-video/\n\nLearn more about whale sharks: http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/whale-shark/\n\nFIELD PRODUCER & VIDEOGRAPHER: Steve De Neef  \nPRODUCER: J.P.

They take turns boxing with her. She will either fight them off, letting them know it is too early to mate, or she will test their strength and submit if she finds them to be adequate partners.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

A relative of the seahorse, it was known only from preserved specimens for nearly a century. Analysis by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego and the Western Australia Museum recently showed that the specimens formed a distinct species. But the animal still had never been filmed alive in its natural habitat. Now, members of the same team report that they have captured footage of theruby seadragon well-hidden in its deep habitat. \n\nVideo: Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego, adapted by National Geographic\n\nFirst Look: Rare Ruby Seadragon Filmed in the Wild | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/qGzItaufbrs\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-01-17T16:00:04.000Z"},{"id":"L72G8TLtTCk","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/L72G8TLtTCk/0.jpg","title":"He Spent 40 Years Alone in the Woods, and Now Scientists Love Him | Short Film Showcase","description":"Welcome to Gothic, Colorado—one of the coldest places in the United States.

But this is the first time a male monkey has been observed attempting to mate with a female deer. In fact, it's only the second sexual encounter ever reported between two species that are not closely related, the other being between Antarctic fur seals and king penguins. While it could be a case of mistaken identity or a way for the monkey to learn to copulate, scientists believe the most likely explanation is that the male monkey in the video is a \"peripheral male.\" These males are low-ranking member of macaque society that do not typically have access to females to mate with, thus the encounter may have been a way for the monkey to relieve sexual frustration.\n\nRead more about this rare interspecies sexual behavior and the previously observed seal-penguin sexual encounters.\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/01/macaque-monkey-sika-deer-interspecies-mating/\n\nVideo courtesy Alexandre Bonnefoy\n\nFilmed during the creation of the book Saru - Singes du Japon [Saru - Monkeys of Japan]: http://www.issekinicho.fr/editions/produit/saru/\n\nPublisher: Editions Issekinicho\nAuthors: Alexandre Bonnefoy, Cédric Sueur, Marie Pelé\n\nMonkey Tries to Mate With Deer (Rare Interspecies Behavior) | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/SICLBlHizUY\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-01-14T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"KPZuL4ZU-D0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/KPZuL4ZU-D0/0.jpg","title":"A Fish Called Obama | Sea of Hope: America's Underwater Treasures","description":"Marine Biologist Richard Pyle asks National Geographic Explorer in Residence Sylvia Earle to ask President Obama for his permission to have a newly discovered fish named after him. \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡  SEA OF HOPE: AMERICA'S UNDERWATER TREASURES AIRS SUNDAY JANUARY 15 at 7/6c.\n\nAbout Sea of Hope: America's Underwater Treasures:\nFollow ocean legend Sylvia Earle, renowned underwater National Geographic photographer Brian Skerry, writer Max Kennedy and their crew of teenage aquanauts on a year-long quest to establish Blue Parks across an unseen American Wilderness.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

This adaptation happened very quickly in geologic terms, because the sand dunes are only about 10,000 years old.\nVideo courtesy National Science Foundation\n\nWhy These Cute Little Lizards Are Changing Colors to Survive | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/ACuj-pZBqug\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-12-20T18:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"3A-j2LKiOcE","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/3A-j2LKiOcE/0.jpg","title":"Where Does the Waste Go?: A Day in the Life of a Scientist | Continent 7: Antarctica","description":"Join a group of Antarctic scientists as they build the world's coldest porta-potty, known as the \"waste tent.\" It's no surprise that they can't stop laughing because this one stinks to high heaven.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Watch all clips of Continent 7: Antarctica here: http://bit.ly/WatchContinent7Antarctica\n➡ Get More Continent 7: Antarctica: http://bit.ly/Continent7Antarctica\n\nAbout Continent 7:  Antarctica:\nAt -100 degrees F, you'll survive for less than 3 minutes and burn 5,000 calories a day, and boiling water can turn to snow instantly.

Now the water channel is beginning to show signs of drying up again, putting immense pressure on the wildlife in the area and raising the stakes for survival.

Today the fish are making a comeback, and their numbers are causing a bit of trouble for some fishermen and boat captains. One documented example shows an opportunistic grouper stealing a catch from a spear fisherman and then dragging him along. Some are advocating an end to the goliath grouper harvesting ban that has been in place in Florida since 1990.\n\nBut are goliath groupers plentiful enough that they should be fished again?

When he was 17 years old, he got his first big break as a photographer when he was asked to photograph urban wildlife in Britain as a part of the 2020Vision project. Initially disappointed in his assignment and wishing he could photograph \"more exciting\" wildlife, Gregory soon realized that you can have a wildlife experience in the city that is just as exciting as anywhere else. He takes the stage to share his love for peregrine falcons and stories from his time photographing animals in the urban jungle.\n\nUpcoming Events at National Geographic Live\nhttp://events.nationalgeographic.com/events/\n\nLearn more about Bertie Gregory\nhttp://www.bertiegregory.com\n\nPRODUCER: Hilary Hudson\nEDITOR: Adam Lee\nTECHNICAL DIRECTOR: John McDonald\nSERIES PRODUCER: Chris Mattle\nADDITIONAL PHOTO: Ocean Simone Shine \nAdventures in Photographing England's Urban Wildlife | Nat Geo Live\nhttps://youtu.be/-v90nD2Fe5k\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-11-01T15:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"wAAalc8ifVI","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/wAAalc8ifVI/0.jpg","title":"Going Solar in NYC | Years of Living Dangerously","description":"Cecily Strong visits a company that’s gone solar, with a little help from the New York State clean energy program.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Watch all clips of Years of Living Dangerously here: http://bit.ly/WatchYearsofLivingDangerously\n➡ Get More Years of Living Dangerously: http://bit.ly/NGYearsofLivingDangerously\n\nAbout Years of Living Dangerously:\nIn this groundbreaking event series, celebrity correspondents bring us stories on those affected by, and seeking solutions to, climate change - from locations shockingly close to home.

Tourists can test their fears and witness firsthand this predatory behavior—seen only in a few places around the world—if they can stomach the claustrophobia, utter darkness, and thousands of bats flying around them while, just a few feet away, dozens of serpents hang from crevices in the cave ceiling, waiting to snatch their next meal.\n\nWould You Dare Enter the Caves of the Hanging Serpents? | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/CR3JLwZxY9Q\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-10-31T12:00:01.000Z"},{"id":"_2XVw0STQ2I","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/_2XVw0STQ2I/0.jpg","title":"President Obama and Climate Change | Before the Flood","description":"Leonardo DiCaprio discusses the UNFCCC Paris agreement and the future impacts of climate change with U.S. President Barack Obama.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Native to Mexico, the axolotl is an unusual amphibian that has deep roots in Aztec mythology. According to legend, this “water monster” was a god who disguised himself as a salamander to avoid sacrifice. Nowadays, it is critically endangered in the wild because of the pollution and urban sprawl that threaten its habitat in the Mexican Basin.\n\nScientists and local people have joined together to save the axolotl from extinction. Through a breeding program, new colonies of axolotls are released into a restricted area where they can thrive under close monitoring.

They’re also more popular than ever, but the Park Service says most of the visitors are older, leaving many to wonder if the next generation will continue to appreciate the National Park System.

There is no access to the Internet and no phone signal.  Then imagine a surprise visit in the middle of the night from two unexpected and adorable guests.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Watch all clips of Expedition Raw here: http://bit.ly/WatchmoreExpeditionRaw\n➡ Get More Expedition Raw on Youtube: http://bit.ly/NGExpeditionRaw\n\nAbout Expedition Raw:\nSurprises, challenges, and amazing behind-the-scenes moments captured by National Geographic explorers in the field.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

By alerting the bears to their presence, the pair greatly reduced their chance of being attacked.  “They hear us, and there's carnage outside. They're scrapping around, they're running in all directions, and then everything goes quiet.\n\n“I unzip the tent, slowly, and there's nothing to see. When I turn around to go back toward the tent, I glance up,” he says. Two feet from the tent stands a tree with the two black bear cubs that Gregory had been tracking just days earlier. “I have two things in my head. The first thing is, Awww, that is the cutest thing ever,\" he says. Then he moved on to practical matters. \"We need to back off here to make sure that the mum can come in and take those cubs down.” Gregory, who has found himself often in the presence of bears, asked Skinner to calmly exit the tent.\n\n\"I'm saying, Becca, come, bring that,\" by which he meant to bring the camera. “Becca thought I was pointing at the bear spray. I was like, No, no, we don't need that, give me the camera.\"\n\nEncounters with wild animals are routine for Gregory. “I think people assume that that's a scary experience, but I've been lucky to have been mentored by some people that know how to act around bears. With black bears, you give them space. I like to talk to them in a very calm voice, so they know where you are, especially in the dark. When they're surprised, that's when there's a potentially dangerous encounter.” He notes that female bears can be particularly protective of their cubs and may react aggressively if they feel they are in danger.\n\nSkinner left the tent with a camera. Minutes later, the female bear returned. “The first one came down pretty quick. The second one was much more nervous,” Gregory says. “As long as I'm not getting in between the mum and her cubs, or I'm not threatening the safety of the cubs in the eyes of the mother, it's not a dangerous encounter.”\n\nClimbing trees is essential for these animals. Cubs often use trees as a defense mechanism to hide from adult male bears who want to kill them in order to produce offspring of their own. “Their safe place is up a tree,” Gregory says.\n\nBritish Columbia has one of the densest populations of black bears in the world. “Bears are around our camp all of the time. We know that from the tracks, we see them every now and again. We also keep our food up a tree to make sure we don't have any problems with them, but I never expected to have a bear encounter quite as close as this one,” Gregory says.\n\n“It was funny because it was completely out of the blue, and those are the kinds of moments that you remember. It's not the slogging down the beach with 50 pounds of gear on your back, or wading through an icy cold river, or staying up into the night. It's the chance encounters that you could never plan, that you could never script—they're the things that stay with you.”\n\nGregory is a 2015 National Geographic Scientific Exploration Society Zenith Explorer, National Geographic Young Explorer, Youth Outdoor Photographer of the Year, wildlife photographer, filmmaker, and host of wild_life with bertie gregory.\nhttp://nationalgeographic.org/\n\nFor more on Gregory, check out National Geographic’s first digital series, wild_life with bertie gregory.

Think Twice About Your Coffee Lid. | Short Film Showcase","description":"Near Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean, currents define the Sargasso Sea—the only sea that is not defined by land boundaries. Known by some as a floating rain forest, the Sargasso Sea is named for the free-floating seaweed Sargassum and provides food and shelter for a vast variety of wildlife. However, those same currents carry a huge amount of plastics that eventually break down in the water and are eaten by small fish and other species that are then eaten by larger fish. The toxic chemicals intensify as they move up the food chain through these animals—right onto our plates. This short film by Justin Lewis is a straightforward look at the impact single-use plastics have on oceans, wildlife, and humans.\nJustin Lewis: http://www.justinlewis.com/\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Get More Short Film Showcase: http://bit.ly/ShortFilmShowcase\n\nAbout Short Film Showcase:\nA curated collection of the most captivating documentary shorts from filmmakers around the world.

David Hamlin was on assignment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo when he saw a female and two male giraffes peacefully making their way through the tall grass. The next morning he learned that the three animals were found shot and mutilated. Shocked by the news and compelled to uncover the truth, Hamlin decided to visit the site of the killings to document this horrific act. Accompanied by armed rangers from the nonprofit conservation organization African Parks and the Congolese Parks Authority ICCN, he ventured through the volatile grounds of Garamba National Park. There he learned that the giraffes were killed for something worth thousands of U.S. dollars: their tails. \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

But could their daily two-wheeled commute do more harm than good? That's the question researchers at Columbia University are trying to answer as part of an ongoing air pollution study in New York City. In partnership with WNYC public radio, the school has been recruiting bicyclists from around the city to wear special monitoring devices on their morning commutes. From the data collected, which include GPS locations and particulate-matter concentrations, the researchers are able to map out air pollution exposure levels along the routes. Bikers are of special interest, as they breathe deeper and ride close to traffic, one of many pollution sources in the city. Though still in its early stages, the study could have implications for city planning that would keep the health of bicycle commuters in mind.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.
