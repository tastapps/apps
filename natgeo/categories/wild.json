You need all 4 of these fat hormones to work in harmony to properly dispose of unwanted body fat.\n\nThe 4 most significant steps to perpetual fat loss:\n\n1. Lowering Ghrelin levels so you aren't craving \"bad foods\".\n2. Restoring \"Insulin Imbalance\" so you can reduce glucose levels in the blood.\n3. Reducing \"Cortisol Overload\" which harms your ability to burn fat at higher levels.\n4. Boosting Adiponectin levels to increase fat burning metabolism!\n\nWhen these 4 hormones are out of whack, your fat can get caged inside your fat cells so it is unavailable to be burned no matter how little you eat or how much you exercise or work out.\n\nEverything is in the 4 PDF books. Now you can clearly see why having control of all 4 fat hormones gives your body the fighting chance it needs to reduce new fat storage and release stubborn fat stores \"locked deep inside fat cells\" for energy.\n\nVisit: https://lixtle.com/4weekdiet to download The 4 Week Diet Launch Book (PDF) for free or to get the full program discounted.\n\nVideo Details:\n\nThe 4 Week Diet System, Here is why it's different (Free Book) [2018]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7xD_g1T4pE\n\nFollow us on...\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/JohnKodey\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheHealthChat\nHomepage: https://lixtle.com","date":"2017-12-12T02:03:18.000Z"},{"id":"8vimuP14Aw4","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/8vimuP14Aw4/0.jpg","title":"In Search Of The Silent Fate - Amazing Austin Steven's Snakes Documentary","description":"In Search Of The Silent Fate - Amazing Austin Steven's Snakes Documentary\nüî∑ Watch also \"The Truth About Acne\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx4Kb9uOlx0\nüî∑ Watch also \"The Metabolism Booster\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LT8Z-V2dFI\n\nAustin follows the trail of the elusive bushmaster, the Americas' largest venomous snake, fighting malarial fever, angry llamas and a bird-eating spider along the way.

As you can see in this excerpt from its table of contents, it really does cover quite a vast range of topics.\n\nIt starts with the management of the toxicity factors (how to detoxify your body) but it also cover many little known factors such as the spinal subluxation, and the psychological factors that a lot of other books about the natural treatment of psoriasis overlook.\n\nSo I'd say its thoroughness as well as attention to little known details is definitely a strong point of the Psoriasis Revolution book / program / system. Now I did find that the writing was very smooth and easily understood. He was very clear and the instructions were quite specific and practical. I would say that if you truly diligently apply the advice contained in the Psoriasis Revolution PDF book, it will likely cure your psoriasis or at least dramatically alleviate it with time. It does work.\". \n\nPsoriasis is a rather stubborn disease so it's not something that you cure overnight. You do need to be diligent over time, but if you apply the methods in this ebook i think most people would get very satisfying results.\".\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Click https://lixtle.com/psorev-discount to download The Psoriasis Revolution Program and to start applying the most effective natural treatment for psoriasis.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and click / tap the bell icon button for more health documentaries:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/BestDocumentariesHD?sub_confirmation=1\n\nMore information about psoriasis:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis","date":"2016-12-14T18:16:15.000Z"},{"id":"p6MnbH38iCs","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/p6MnbH38iCs/0.jpg","title":"Fast Plantar Fasciitis Cure - Remedies for plantar fasciitis ‚òëÔ∏è","description":"‚ú≥Ô∏è Visit: https://lixtle.com/plantarfasc for the Fast Plantar Fasciitis Cure Program, with the most effective exercises and remedies for plantar fasciitis.\n\nLiving with Plantar Fasciitis is unbelievably uncomfortable.

They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but Nepal didn't allow the British to enter the country.\n\nThis video is related to:\n\n- Everest expedition to the death zone\n- Everest backpack from the base camp\n- Everest climb the peak and summit\n- Everest disaster, avalanche and tragedy\n- Everest documentary imax\n- BBC Documentaries\n- BBC Documentary\n- Nat Geo Documentary\n- National Geographic Documentary\n- National Geographic Documentaries\n- Discovery Channel\n- JohnKodey\n- kode34jh90y\n\nVideo Details:\n\nEverest Expedition And Backpack Climb To The Peak - Full Nat Geo Documentary\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JJ-5Vn1eOU\n\nYouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/JohnKodey\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/kodeykon","date":"2016-08-11T05:45:56.000Z"},{"id":"bORAGhGa8TU","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/bORAGhGa8TU/0.jpg","title":"Amazon Rainforest Animals, Plants And Sounds - Full Nat Geo Documentary","description":"Amazon Rainforest Animals, Plants And Sounds - Full Nat Geo Documentary\n‚ú≥Ô∏è Skyrocket your metabolism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7xD_g1T4pE\n\nMore than half of the world's species of plants, trees and animals are found in the rainforest (sometimes also spelled as \"rain forest\").

Sinkholes may be formed gradually or suddenly, and are found worldwide. On 2 July 2015, scientists reported that active pits, related to sinkhole collapses and possibly associated with outbursts, have been found on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the Rosetta space probe.\n\nSinkholes may capture surface drainage from standing or running water, but may also form in high and dry places in specific locations.\n\nThe formation of sinkholes involves natural processes of erosion [9] or gradual removal of slightly soluble bedrock (such as limestone) by percolating water, the collapse of a cave roof, or a lowering of the water table. Sinkholes often form through the process of suffosion. Thus, for example, groundwater may dissolve the carbonate cement holding the sandstone particles together and then carry away the lax particles, gradually forming a void.\n\nOccasionally a sinkhole may exhibit a visible opening into a cave below. In the case of exceptionally large sinkholes, such as the Miny√É¬© sinkhole in Papua New Guinea or Cedar Sink at Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky, an underground stream or river may be visible across its bottom flowing from one side to the other.\n\nSinkholes are common where the rock below the land surface is limestone or other carbonate rock, salt beds, or in other rocks, such as gypsum, [10] that can be dissolved naturally by circulating ground water. Sinkholes also occur in sandstone and quartzite terrains.\n\nAs the rock dissolves, spaces and caverns develop underground. These sinkholes can be dramatic, because the surface land usually stays intact until there is not enough support. Then, a sudden collapse of the land surface can occur.\n\nSinkholes may capture surface drainage from standing or running water, but may also form in dry and high places in specific locations.\n\nSinkholes often form through the process of suffosion.

It was the first time any journalist, let alone a foreign reporter, had gained access. It was the beginning of an unusual relationship that Mark forged with the prison governor, Subkan Dadashiov.\n\nMark and Nick Read met working on a documentary for the BBC: ‚ÄòBritain‚Äôs Most Wanted‚Äô about Andrei Lugovoi, who was accused of the murder & polonium poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in the UK. The film was widely acclaimed, and Mark and Nick forged a uniquely collaborative filmmaking partnership, going on to develop several more films together.\n\nBoth were committed to finding new audiences and platforms for their films, and became fascinated by the possibilities of longer form story-telling, and the potential of making feature length documentaries for the cinema. They discussed the possibility of re-visiting Penal Colony 56 in February 2012, and a phone call to the governor suggested that he would agree.\nEvery single man there is a murderer. Some mad, some bad, and some who just lost their minds in the wrong place and time. This first trip was scheduled at just 10 days. After meeting nearly 100 of the 260 inmates in the first few days, instinct had to guide us to the strongest characters ‚Äì but then there was a feast of riches.\n\nVisually as the cameraman, Nick was intent on capturing the claustrophobia and textures of this decaying institution, built in Soviet times, full of atmosphere. There was never a moment of silence there ‚Äì the air filled with human sounds, and of locks turning, doors slamming.\n\nOne of the first ‚Äòlifers‚Äô Mark & Nick met was confined to a single man cell, 23 hours a day for the rest of his life. Yet, he told us, he was ‚Äòtoo busy to talk to us‚Äô. Initially we thought him one of the mad, but in time we learnt that one of the main survival skills for these prisoners is a strict regime. To disturb it was unthinkable for this inmate, and we regrettably were unable to persuade him to take part.\nReturning to see our original cast meant that Mark could draw them out even more in interview, to fulfill a mission to see ‚Äòinside their souls‚Äô while looking at the whites of their eyes. Eventually though, we could leave ‚Äì most of the prisoners will remain with little hope of release until their dying day.\n\nMost of all we hope that the testimony of these forgotten men, set in the unique atmosphere of their remote habitat, provides a story that will live long in the memory.\n* Subscribe for more Scientific & Technological Videos\n* Like & Share\n* go to our website http://www.advexon.com\n* Share your ideas and comment","date":"2016-06-08T20:27:36.000Z"},{"id":"DKyb_0GojTE","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/DKyb_0GojTE/0.jpg","title":"Next Future : Most Advanced Helicopters of U.S Army - Full Documentary","description":"Also Don‚Äôt miss new videos in our channel \n\nTOP 5 Most DANGEROUS WEAPON #MIND BLOW 2017\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d7FS-IutBE\n\nNEW Project Russian Weapons| Nasty SURPRISE FOR US Military 2017\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWsAY823jik\n\nWORLDS MOST POWERFUL !

Come with us to this forest which connects the purest nature of their tribes.\n\n‚ñ∂ SUBSCRIBE! http://bit.ly/PlanetDoc Full Documentaries every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday!\n‚ñ∂ FULL DOCUMENTARIES | http://bit.ly/Full-Docs\n\n00:10 These mysterious lands which seem to rise out of the clouds are the Highlands, in the east of the island of New Guinea, to the north of Australia. Ambassadors of the Jungle live here. The fierce nature of these tribes, the practice of cannibalism and the fact that some groups cut off the heads of their enemies all this made the island a fearful place, which travellers tried to avoid.\n\n09:00 The ‚Äòmud men‚Äô tribe live near Goroca, along the upper reaches of the Asaro river. Their strange means of defence is to turn into spirits and frighten off their enemies. For this, they make these masks of mud which, with their grotesque, exaggerated features. Once they have finished their masks, the warriors daub their bodies with mud, which they will later dye grey with another, more liquid, type of mud.\n\n15:13 Today they have gathered together to prepare mono.  The ‚Äòmonos‚Äô, the main ingredient, are small, sweet bananas, which they scrape with a bamboo cane knife, shredding them into small pieces. Once cooked, this pulp will be of the texture of a thick bechamel sauce.\n\n21:38 We are going to see the mummies of the Enga or Kukukuku that is the name normally given to these cannibal warriors who live on the plains of the Aseki river. Cannibalism has always been common practice among the Kukukuku, and it is this that has made them legendary.  They ate thieves and prisoners of war, after fattening them up for a while. Leaders and warriors who died in battle were mummified. Cannibalism has almost entirely died out, though there are still isolated cases of human flesh being eaten in the most remote regions.\n\n27:53 An important institution for these peoples is the Tanimet, seductive dances or courting ceremony.  The men invite the women from a different village.  The Highlander culture is exogamous it is forbidden to marry relatives and so they have to look for wives outside their own village.  Men can have as many wives as they can support, but the women can have only one husband. The songs speak of love affairs, and list the obligations of the future wifes.  \n\n30:25 In the next part of this documentary we going to north of Papua New Guinea where we find a very different region to the highlands, around the Sepik river. The spiritual life of these people is centred on the tambaran or house of the spirits. On special occasions, they get together, dressed in traditional costumes, and dance naked around the tambaran. In this way, they call on the spirits that protect them. \n\n41:18 In the village of Timbumeri, on the southern shore of lake Chambri, the garamut tom-toms sound out, announcing the initiation ceremony of the crocodile men. From dawn, all the men of the village start work, preparing the ritual. By the river, beside the tambaran, they build a crocodile nest. The uninitiated, and the women, are not allowed to see what happens inside this area which represents the heart of the spirit of the king of crocodiles.\nThe men of these societies in Sepik subject themselves to real torture. With several hundred cuts, their skin takes on the appearance of that of their crocodile gods.\n\nSUBSCRIBE | http://bit.ly/PlanetDoc\nFULL DOCUMENTARIES | http://bit.ly/Full-Docs\n‚ñ∂ TRIBES DOCUMENTARIES | http://bit.ly/PlTribes\nFACEBOOK | http://bit.ly/FBPDoc\nTWITTER | http://bit.ly/TwPDoc\nTUMBLR | http://bit.ly/TbPlDoc","date":"2014-12-13T14:00:11.000Z"},{"id":"zyNI0fO-qjc","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/zyNI0fO-qjc/0.jpg","title":"Acne No More PDF Download (Mike Walden) - How to clear up acne fast ‚úÖ","description":"Acne No More PDF Download (Mike Walden) - How to clear up acne fast.\n‚ú≥Ô∏è Click https://lixtle.com/acnenomore-pdf and download your copy of Acne No More PDF.

After having a spiritual awakening, Hamilton is led to the Amazon where he apprentices as an Ayahuascero, or person who practices medicine with Ayahuasca.

It departs from classical mechanics primarily at the quantum realm of atomic and subatomic length scales. Quantum mechanics provides a mathematical description of much of the dual particle-like and wave-like behavior and interactions of energy and matter. Quantum mechanics provides a substantially useful framework for many features of the modern periodic table of elements including the behavior of atoms during chemical bonding and has played a significant role in the development of many modern technologies.\n\nIn advanced topics of quantum mechanics, some of these behaviors are macroscopic (see macroscopic quantum phenomena) and emerge at only extreme (i.e., very low or very high) energies or temperatures (such as in the use of superconducting magnets). For example, the angular momentum of an electron bound to an atom or molecule is quantized. In contrast, the angular momentum of an unbound electron is not quantized. In the context of quantum mechanics, the wave--particle duality of energy and matter and the uncertainty principle provide a unified view of the behavior of photons, electrons, and other atomic-scale objects.\n\nThe mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are abstract. A mathematical function, the wavefunction, provides information about the probability amplitude of position, momentum, and other physical properties of a particle. Mathematical manipulations of the wavefunction usually involve bra--ket notation which requires an understanding of complex numbers and linear functionals. The wavefunction formulation treats the particle as a quantum harmonic oscillator, and the mathematics is akin to that describing acoustic resonance. Many of the results of quantum mechanics are not easily visualized in terms of classical mechanics. For instance, in a quantum mechanical model the lowest energy state of a system, the ground state, is non-zero as opposed to a more \"traditional\" ground state with zero kinetic energy (all particles at rest). Instead of a traditional static, unchanging zero energy state, quantum mechanics allows for far more dynamic, chaotic possibilities, according to John Wheeler.\n\nThe earliest versions of quantum mechanics were formulated in the first decade of the 20th century. About this time, the atomic theory and the corpuscular theory of light (as updated by Einstein)[1] first came to be widely accepted as scientific fact; these latter theories can be viewed as quantum theories of matter and electromagnetic radiation, respectively. Early quantum theory was significantly reformulated in the mid-1920s by Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and Pascual Jordan, (matrix mechanics); Louis de Broglie and Erwin Schr√∂dinger (wave mechanics); and Wolfgang Pauli and Satyendra Nath Bose (statistics of subatomic particles). Moreover, the Copenhagen interpretation of Niels Bohr became widely accepted. By 1930, quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by the work of David Hilbert, Paul Dirac and John von Neumann[2] with a greater emphasis placed on measurement in quantum mechanics, the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality, and philosophical speculation about the role of the observer. Quantum mechanics has since permeated throughout many aspects of 20th-century physics and other disciplines including quantum chemistry, quantum electronics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. Much 19th-century physics has been re-evaluated as the \"classical limit\" of quantum mechanics and its more advanced developments in terms of quantum field theory, string theory, and speculative quantum gravity theories. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsVGut7G-dU\n\nquantum solace, quantum world, #quantum","date":"2014-05-25T18:38:25.000Z"},{"id":"lZZGpMjJr4A","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/lZZGpMjJr4A/0.jpg","title":"Cars of the Future [Full Documentary]","description":"Car Technology of the Future\nOne perspective of what automobiles of the future might be capable of.\n\nSince this is a few years old now, how have our perspectives changed? \nPlease discuss bellow:","date":"2014-03-30T03:57:39.000Z"},{"id":"uQ91AxUqHck","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/uQ91AxUqHck/0.jpg","title":"Planet Earth 100 Million Years In The Future - What will happen to our world? - HD Full Documentary","description":"SUBSCRIBE to WORLD GEOGRAPHIC CHANNEL and never be bored again:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=WorldGeographicChan\n\n\nRecommend book: \nIf You Think You Are Free: Life Lessons And The Truth Of Enlightenment\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/1980929084\n\n\nWORLD GEOGRAPHIC CHANNEL is a broad category of Amazing Documentaries from around the world, whenever you are bored, want to watch tv, open WORLD GEOGRAPHIC CHANNEL and have unlimited great entertainment, as you learn about the world and see all its amazing beauty.\n\nWORLD GEOGRAPHIC CHANNEL is based on the attempt, in one fashion or another, to document reality.

Randi also teaches us that illusion and trickery may be comforting to the human mind, but truth is far much more wonderful as it shows us the machinations from the chaos, the sense as well as the awe in both the tricks and the real world.\n\nFor several decades, Randi has gone on to expose hundreds of psychics and teach millions across the globe about how they could be fooled into believing in a system which could potentially make them vulnerable to trickery and perhaps psychical harm. \n\nRandi is not afraid to go against popular opinion, as shown in his battle against so-called psychic Uri Geller in the late 1970's and early 1980's. \nRandi has also gone against the bizarre practice of faith \"healing\" and contacting the deceased, and has exposed the cruel, callous and cynical nature of the people who claim to be performing \"God's will\", such as Peter Popoff.\nRandi has also warned us time and time again about the fraudulent practice that is homeopathic medicine and how it is essentially water solution, dished out as hocus-pocus medicine. \n\nJames Randi is the founder of The James Randi Educational Foundation, an organisation that attempts to bring reason to world by luring potential psychics into a trap, baited by a million dollar prize to prove their psychic \"powers\". \"powers\" here is a kind of vague term,as Randi knows, so the tests are usually on the so-called psychic's terms. No self-acclaimed psychic has ever won the prize.\n\nWhether or not some form of psychic power exists is still an open question, however many psychics often do not properly gauge their so-called skills and instead brag about them, hence scepticism about such claims should not be so strange to their ears. \n\nUnfortunately the vast amount of psychic powers they have seem to remove all self-esteem as many psychics are often uneasy about Randi's reasonable request and attractive million dollar reward.","date":"2012-11-17T21:06:05.000Z"},{"id":"dSDJKt6V5p0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/dSDJKt6V5p0/0.jpg","title":"Spiders - The Spider Hunter, Full Length Documentary","description":"Spiders - The Spider Hunter, Full Length Documentary\nüî∑ Watch also \"Skyrocket your metabolism\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7xD_g1T4pE\n\nSpiders.

A few deaths have been attributed to the use of ayahuacsa, although the causes of the deaths have not all been conclusively determined. In at least some cases ayahuasca use might have directly resulted in the fatality.\n\nThe primary risks associated with ayahuasca are the inclusion of a MAOI as a definitional component of the brew and the fact that there is no single recipe for ayahuasca and admixture plants can include any of a wide variety of psychoactives including Datura or Brugmansia. MAOIs can be dangerous because they inhibit an enzyme important in the metabolic breakdown of many foods and drugs. The combination of MAOIs with certain drugs, particularly stimulants, can lead to dangerous or potentially fatal medical situations.\n\nTraditional ayahuasca use involves a complex set of pre-ceremony dietary guidelines that exclude many foods and modern shamans require that participants stop using most pharmaceuticals (even anti-malarial and anti-diarrhea drugs) in order to take ayahuasca with them. Additionally, the strength/potency of ayahuasca brews varies from batch to batch, which can impact the risks related to contraindicated combinations.\n\nFinally, the term \"ayahuasca\" is sometimes used for \"pharmahuasca\" or blends of pure or extracted chemicals combined to mimic the effects of the traditional ayahuasca brews. The health risks associated with all drugs are dose-dependent and pharmahuasca-type ayahuascas can easily include much higher dose levels than plant-based ayahuascas and are often consumed by less experienced self-experimenters and often without experienced sitter/guide.\n\nFamous Case: Kyle Nolan - September 2012\nVery widely reported ayahuasca-related fatality of an 18-year-old young man. Kyle Nolan travelled to Peru to take part in an ayahuasca ceremony, but died while there. The shaman, Jose Manuel Pineda, buried Mr. Nolan's body and later told his family Kyle had simply gone missing. On further investigation, the shaman admitted that Kyle had died during the ceremony, and said he had taken an excessive dose. Nolan's family was suspicious and his father stated, \"I believe my son was murdered because people don't die from ingesting ayahuasca\". As of April 2013, no final information indicating Kyle died from ayahuasca ingestion has been published.\n\nsource: EROWID\nhttp://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_death.shtml","date":"2012-08-09T17:45:14.000Z"},{"id":"ZRuSS0iiFyo","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/ZRuSS0iiFyo/0.jpg","title":"The Cannibal Warlords of Liberia (Full Length Documentary)","description":"Like VICE News?

Despite the United Nation's eventual intervention, most of Liberia's young people continue to live in abject poverty, surrounded by filth, drug addiction, and teenage prostitution. The former child soldiers who were forced into war have been left to fend for themselves, the murderous warlords who once led them in cannibalistic rampages have taken up as so-called community leaders, and new militias are lying in wait for the opportunity to reclaim their country from a government they rightly mistrust.\n\nHosted by Shane Smith | Originally released in 2009 at http://vice.com\n\nProduced by Andy Capper\n\nFollow Andy at http://twitter.com/andycapper\n\nMore from Shane Smith: http://www.vice.com/author/shane-smith\nFollow Shane on Twitter: https://twitter.com/shanesmith30\n\nCheck out the VICE Guide to Karachi here: http://bit.ly/Karachi-1\n\nSubscribe for videos that are actually good: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://www.youtube.com/user/vice/videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com","date":"2012-06-13T17:30:46.000Z"},{"id":"eYG0ZuTv5rs","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/eYG0ZuTv5rs/0.jpg","title":"Stress, Portrait of a Killer - Full Documentary (2008)","description":"my artworks: http://ndooza.blogspot.com\nsubtitles are available in 76 languages in the settings icon, you can improve them on this page (please send me a message so that I can upload it): http://www.amara.org/en/videos/ZoXiuqhJ9w79/info/stress-portrait-of-a-killer-full-documentary-2008/\nother awesome, more in depth Sapolsky presentations: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D","date":"2011-10-16T19:37:17.000Z"},{"id":"JGW4nXE9LrE","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/JGW4nXE9LrE/0.jpg","title":"ILLUMINATI a myth?
