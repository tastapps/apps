Their destination is the space between two peaks. It's an especially challenging location for the sport. More than 500 feet off the ground, the crew anchors a 1400-foot slackline into ice on each face. In slacklining, a nylon strip stretches with the walker's weight.

That access makes the peaks an attractive landscape for paramotor pilots like Chris Reynolds, who lives in nearby Big Lake. In ultralight aircraft, pilots are free to skim the terrain's contours. Just 50 miles east of Anchorage the Knik Glacier spills out from the Chugach Range over more than 100,000 acres. This glacier extends 28 miles starting up around the 13,000-foot peak of Mount Marcus Baker, the highest in the Chugach. Formed in the Pleistocene, the whole glacier is in motion, sliding downhill at less than 0.0001 MPH. Every day at the terminus, icebergs calve and feed the Knik River. Like most of the region's glaciers, the Knik is losing more ice each year than precipitation can replace. Despite its proximity to the city, you can't get to Knik Glacier by road. But that's no obstacle if you can take to the sky.\n\nRead more in \"Paraglider Soars Over Alaska Glacier in Thrilling Video\"\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/alaska/paragliding-alaska-travel-spd\n\nParamotor Flight Over Alaska's Chugach Mountains and Knik Glacier | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/9FfH6ZHj3lg\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-04-18T17:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"JuH6kdN6NBs","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/JuH6kdN6NBs/0.jpg","title":"People on the Street React to the Moon in the Most Awe-inspiring Way | Short Film Showcase","description":"\"Do you want to take a look at the moon?\"\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Get More Short Film Showcase: http://bit.ly/ShortFilmShowcase\n\nAbout Short Film Showcase:\nThe Short Film Showcase spotlights exceptional short videos created by filmmakers from around the web and selected by National Geographic editors.

A destination for mountain climbers since at least the 16th century, the summit became accessible for casual visitors in 1889, when the Pilatus-Bahn began operation. The railway runs between the town of Alpnachstad and Pilatus Kulm, the peak—a trip of less than three miles. But what made it noteworthy then—and now—is its steep ascent. The maximum grade is 25.6 degrees, or 48 percent, meaning it gains 48 feet in elevation for every 100 feet due forward, disregarding incline. That's far steeper than any conventional railroad. Hence its very particular record: the world's steepest cogwheel railway.\n\nA Swiss Alpine Train Ride is Dizzyingly Steep | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/WTSBRl8rbgo\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-04-04T17:00:06.000Z"},{"id":"GBFvuDg7Tx8","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/GBFvuDg7Tx8/0.jpg","title":"Now in Their 70s, Two Friends Return to the Arctic for One More Adventure | Short Film Showcase","description":"Over a span of 40 years, adventurous friends Jim Slinger and Andrew “Tip” Taylor have embarked on more than 30 river expeditions together.

Each year, streaked shearwaters  visit the coasts and islands of East Asia to breed, returning from their winter journeys to tropical and subtropical waters. Because of their wide and varied range, much of which is far from land, Katsufumi Sato, National Geographic explorer and University of Tokyo behavioral ecologist, has made these oceangoing birds a part of his research team. By outfitting the shearwaters with lightweight weather data recorders, Sato is able to capture information from points on the ocean, including temperature, wind speed, and currents, and compare it with results from other sources. He plans to add transmitters to the instruments, which could augment data coming in from ships, buoys, and satellites.\n\nTHE YEAR OF THE BIRD\nIn 1918 Congress passed the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to protect birds from wanton killing. To celebrate the centennial, National Geographic is partnering with the National Audubon Society, BirdLife International, and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to declare 2018 the Year of the Bird.

Conservators with Madrid-based Da Vinci Restauro were examining a crucifix from a church about 80 miles north of the Spanish capital. The statue turned out to be hollow with a removable panel. Located on the figure’s backside, the opening was hidden by the cross. Inside lay a letter describing life in Spain in 1777, written by a chaplain, Joaquín Mínguez. The priest names the reigning monarch, Carlos III, catalogues crops and products such as wine. He tells of the Inquisition and of happier customs, with music and games. Mínguez seems to have intentionally placed the letter to serve as a time capsule. The document itself will go to an archive.

The delta is a wildlife paradise and home to many exotic animals like elephants, hippos, sitatungas, and African fish eagles. But the delta is in danger as Angola seeks to develop the upper reaches of the Cuito and Cubango. Increasingly, forests along the banks are being burned down for river access, hunting, and subsistence crops. With these growing pressures, the future of the delta is at stake. The Okavango Wilderness Project is rooted in this cause. National Geographic Society sponsored an intrepid expedition team to research and survey the headwaters and document the need to protect the ecosystem. This animated video will reveal some the team's wildlife discoveries and the environmental concerns the delta faces—as well as the tricky business of conservation across political borders. \n\nRead the entire story in the November 2017 issue of National Geographic: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/11/africa-expedition-conservation-okavango-delta-cuito/\n\nSaving One of the Most Pristine Wetlands on Earth | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/_PxcgX-LetM\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-11-29T13:00:03.000Z"},{"id":"4pywFRpEcZA","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/4pywFRpEcZA/0.jpg","title":"How Did the 'Unsinkable' Titanic End Up at the Bottom of the Ocean? | National Geographic","description":"Over a hundred years ago, the Titanic sank beneath the Atlantic Ocean in less than three hours.

The site represents what one of the team's co-leaders reports is the largest known cache of shipwreck cargo in the Mediterranean. In addition to the so-called Antikythera mechanism, a device for tracking celestial movements, the ship carried pottery items and bronze statues. This year's expedition has brought one more fragment of the latter to light, a disembodied arm, much like the \"orphan limbs\" that sponge divers first spotted when they discovered the wreck in 1900. Another bronze artifact just discovered is a disc decorated with the figure of a bull.

But new evidence suggests it was the scene of a bloody battle nearly 1900 years ago. With metal detectors, the researchers searched for Roman ammunition across the site. In hot spots identified by the metal detectors, they excavated several trenches. They found lead sling bullets. Experiments show these have the stopping power of a .44 magnum cartridge. The team also found Roman artillery ammunition known as ballista balls.

Manta rays have rough skin, similar to sandpaper, and suction cups can't achieve a perfect seal. Using previous methods, the cameras only lasted three hours before detaching from the mantas and floating to the surface. \n\nForced to come up with an unconventional solution, researchers used creamy peanut butter to try and improve the seal. To their surprise, the sticky solution doubled the time the cameras stay attached. The footage gathered from this study will be used to study manta ray social behavior, habitat use, and feeding behavior, with hopes that it will improve marine conservation and species protection.\n\nThis research was conducted with support from The Gulf of California Marine Program and The Manta Trust.\nhttp://gulfprogram.ucsd.edu/\nhttp://www.mantatrust.org/\n\nClick here to read more about the study.\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/05/peanut-butter-crittercam-manta-ray-marine-conservation-science/\n\nHow Do You Get a Camera to Stick to a Manta Ray?

Not surprisingly, the team was eager to go back and learn more, but how do you explore an environment that could easily kill you? You send in robots, of course.\n\n“Our goal is to send instrumentation there to get meaningful data, but sometimes it’s really fun to just blow stuff up,” says National Geographic explorer and ocean engineer Brennan Phillips.\n\nBrennan reunited with his 2015 expedition mates—Alistair Grinham of University of Queensland and Matthew Dunbabin of Queensland University of Technology and Director of GFB Robotics—to once again venture about 20 miles off the coast of the Solomon Islands to the Pacific Ocean’s violent Kavachi volcano.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Watch all clips of Expedition Raw here: http://bit.ly/WatchmoreExpeditionRaw\n➡ Get More Expedition Raw on Youtube: http://bit.ly/NGExpeditionRaw\n\nAbout Expedition Raw:\nSurprises, challenges, and amazing behind-the-scenes moments captured by National Geographic explorers in the field.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nWe talked to Brennan and Matthew about their return to “Sharkcano.”\n\nQ: Why send robots into one of the most active submarine volcanoes on Earth?\n\nBrenna Phillips: Cause it's cool. But also, as a scientist, it's about getting that last data point, right before the eruption—pH, carbon dioxide, temperature fluctuations, acidity. \n\nMatthew Dunbabin: After looking at a friend’s amazing video of Kavachi’s past eruptions, hearing about the remoteness of the site, and how challenging the conditions are, we were determined to try to get there. This all addresses an interesting problem with monitoring in extreme environments, in that no matter how well-built your systems are or how much they cost, it is very unlikely they will survive an explosion. So, to start increasing our knowledge of these environments you have to develop low-cost monitoring tools that are capable of undertaking meaningful measurements but are not so costly you can’t afford to lose them.\n\nQ: How did you design the robots?\n\nMD:  Kavachi is in a remote part of the Solomon Islands with very limited travel options. So you have to design robots that fit into carry-on luggage on a Twin Otter plane. Also, these robots are considered disposable. Therefore, we are making them as low cost as possible—hundreds of dollars.\n\nBP: In this case we used some used PVC sewer pipe that was found in the village. You just put some electronics onto that and wham-o, you have an autonomous boat.\n\nMD: I like to call it bush robotics.\n\nQ: What did you learn from sending the robots into Kavachi?\n\nMD:  In the vicinity of the vent we found a huge drop in the surface pH levels, water temperatures ten degrees higher than normal, and we learned Kavachi is a strong greenhouse gas emitter. \n\nQ: How did it feel to discover sharks inside a volcano?\n\nBP: Well, to put my scientist hat on there are a number of reasons why there shouldn't be anything living in there except maybe bacteria. Number one it's very hot and acidic, and we measured that. Number two, it's very turbid, so the water is very cloudy. None of these things are good for fish. Whether they're good for sharks, that's up for debate. Yet we saw sharks that in between eruptions are darting in and out between the clouds of the plume. So that's a lingering question mark.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and content.\n\nWatch \"Sharks Discovered Inside Underwater Volcano\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3t18rrjOA&index=45&list=PLivjPDlt6ApSPM8_S83yKQVQtT2Fgwd1L\n\nLearn more at http://natgeo.org/grants and see more exciting moments of explorers in the field in our digital series, Expedition Raw.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLivjPDlt6ApSPM8_S83yKQVQtT2Fgwd1L\n\nPRODUCER / EDITOR : Nora Rappaport\nSERIES PRODUCER: Chris Mattle\nVIDEOGRAPHER: Alex DeCiccio\n\nRobot vs. Volcano: “Sometimes It’s Just Fun to Blow Stuff Up” (Exclusive) | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/Ca0zAAIVK3E\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-04-19T12:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"yytrFWa-OH0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/yytrFWa-OH0/0.jpg","title":"How Water Built and Destroyed This Powerful Empire | National Geographic","description":"Angkor was once a thriving ancient Khmer empire in Cambodia, but it met its demise through a series of catastrophic events: severe drought followed by intense flooding.

Can you tell us why?\n \nA: Planning for this trip, Greenland was totally mysterious. All I could really tell is from looking at satellite imagery of the island and seeing these long fjords covered with this turquoise-blue water, with icebergs everywhere. It looked like a place I'd never been. The unknown to me was the most attractive part.\n \nQ: Why isn't there more information or footage of these areas?\n\nA: It's really hard to get to. If you can get there, the weather is usually horrible. There is a low-pressure system that sits south of Iceland, halfway between Greenland and Europe, that swirls bad weather constantly. We got really lucky because of how perfect the weather was.\n \nQ: Tell us about what you saw in Greenland.\n \nA: The most awe-inspiring thing we saw was big calving events by glaciers. It is absolutely quiet, then all of a sudden you can hear the ice start to fall apart, and it sounds just thunderous. You can't help but realize that Greenland is melting. \n \nAnd as we're flying, we look down at these melt pools, where we see water pooling up and it disappears down a hole. It’s the most beautiful blues I have ever seen—brilliant, turquoise pools of water. But they absorb heat. The more melt pools you have, the quicker Greenland is melting. As Greenland melts, you have to wonder where is all this water going? It's going right into the ocean.\n \nQ: How did you feel flying over places that might not be there much longer?\n\nA: Watching an entire island melt in a way that is unprecedented makes you realize that we are in a very fragile place. It's important for us to be able to capture images of an area that is so unique, a place that is so difficult to get to, to help inspire people about what climate change really is.\n \nQ: What else can Greenland tell us about the global climate?\n \nA: Because the atmosphere of Greenland is so clean you can think of the ice cap as a huge filter, where it'll catch dirt, dust, or debris in the atmosphere; it's going to settle out onto the snow. The biggest source of carbon in the world is from burning fossil fuels and as that goes up in the atmosphere. It's settling out in the ocean but also in Greenland, into the ice. This has been going on for a very long time. \n \nGeologists can go up, drill down, and they can see how the carbon levels have changed in the world over time. You can see when there were big asteroids that hit the planet or a volcano erupted. The ice has this record.\n \nGreenland is on the forefront of climate change. We need to understand what is going on up there so we can make better decisions for our planet. Our planet depends on the science that is happening up in Greenland. \n \nThis interview has been edited for length and content. \n\nLearn more about National Geographic grantees at http://natgeo.org/grants and see more explores in the field in the digital series, Expedition Raw.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLivjPDlt6ApSPM8_S83yKQVQtT2Fgwd1L\n\nPRODUCER: Nora Rappaport\nEDITOR: Dave Nathan\nSERIES PRODUCER: Chris Mattle\nVIDEOGRAPHER: Amanda Kisfaludy\n\nExplorers See Greenland's Glaciers Like Never Before | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/m741CDs1NMI\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-04-05T12:00:08.000Z"},{"id":"7GH6x6vE8OI","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/7GH6x6vE8OI/0.jpg","title":"How Did These Ancient Bugs Attract Mates?

After meeting up with the team in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, his journey was far from over. \n\nFrom there they traveled together a little over a hundred miles by bus, with hundreds of pounds of food and gear for three weeks in the field, across the arid plains. They took a popular tourist route that follows the ancient Silk Road to Samarqand. Then they turned off the beaten path, heading south toward the Afghan border to Boysun, where they loaded everything into a six-wheeled Soviet-era troop transport. As they lumbered into the Boysuntov (also known as Baysun-Tau) Range, the mountains gradually rose to 12,000 feet and then dropped off in a jagged line of spectacular cliffs. Once the route became too steep for the truck, the team hiked for two days with 15 donkeys to haul their supplies up to the base camp, perched on sloping terraces at the foot of the limestone escarpment. It took several days of rigging ropes to access the cave and haul up gear. In the article Synott remembers, \"But finally I hoisted myself up a 450-foot rope to the cave’s main entrance (dubbed Izhevskaya, or R21). I began to see why cavers think of Dark Star as a living, breathing entity. Down at base camp, the temperature hovered around 100°F, but up here I was shocked to find myself bracing against a freezing wind blasting out of Dark Star’s mouth.\" \n\nRead more about the expedition in \"Is This the Underground Everest?\" from National Geographic Magazine. \n\nhttp://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/03/dark-star-deepest-cave-climbing-uzbekistan/\n\nWatch These Cave Divers’ Epic Climb to Dark Star | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/ifm9QzpQ4bA\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-03-22T17:00:06.000Z"},{"id":"40-0azIS-4Q","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/40-0azIS-4Q/0.jpg","title":"This VR Game Shows Kids How to Fight Monsters in the Water | Short Film Showcase","description":"The people of Thailand have been living off the river for generations.

Through their world-class scientists, photographers, journalists, and filmmakers, Nat Geo gets you closer to the stories that matter and past the edge of what's possible.\n\nWith more and more great whites being spotted off the beaches of Cape Cod, Skerry set out to document the massive predators, hoping to learn about their behaviors and shed some light on the oft-misunderstood carnivores. But a lot more than just a beautiful photo was riding on this assignment. \n\n\"Sharks suffer from this terrible one-dimensional view that many people have of them as mindless killers. Because of that, it's been, I believe, easy to almost eradicate sharks,” Skerry says. “Every year more than 100 million sharks are being killed on planet Earth. When you think about the value that predators play to the health of any ecosystem, you realize that we can't kill 100 million sharks and expect the oceans to be healthy.\"\n \n\"I wanted to put a face on this shadowy creature that has been portrayed as a monster and show what they look like,” he adds. “I hope that the viewer takes away that these are complex animals, that we need a more informed view of them, a more progressive view of these animals.\"\n\nA new population of great whites began emerging in Cape Cod in 2009, likely capitalizing on the dense population of tasty gray seals. \"This would be analogous to a new pride of lions emerging in Africa. We just don't see new populations of predators occurring really anywhere that I'm aware of in the natural world,\" Skerry says. \n\n\"What I've ultimately done was work with researchers who designed seal decoys as a way of attracting the shark to look at the predation strategy, because it also seems that the white sharks here are hunting in a different way than they do in other places in the world. I had the idea of installing cameras inside the seal decoys, which are made out of just neoprene and foam so it wouldn't hurt the sharks.\"\n\nThe camera-rigged seal decoys have not only allowed Skerry to put a face to these persecuted animals, but have also provided the scientists with critical data about the sharks' behaviors and hunting habits, which can be used to keep both the sharks and beach-goers safe. \n\nStill, the researchers and Skerry had a friendly rivalry going due to slightly conflicting interests. Skerry explains: \"I wanted a shark that was curious, but not so curious that he destroyed the seal decoy and my camera. Tom Burns [the shark researcher] would be cheering for a full-on breach where the shark came out of the water with the decoy in its mouth. \n\nIn the end, both Burns and Skerry could celebrate, having gotten photos and data that tell the stories of great whites in Cape Cod and help inform how we can best protect them and nearby humans. \n\n\"Yes, they are predators; yes, they have the ability to do great damage; yes, we should be concerned about them and be smart about how we interact and coexist, but these are animals that have survived for hundreds of millions of years. They've outlived dinosaurs and many other animals along the way. They've evolved to an epitome of evolutionary perfection, [so] that they are perfect for the environment in which they live. We should celebrate that. We should marvel at that and respect it,\" Skerry says. \n\n\"These are animals that, I believe, are better having in our world. The more that we can learn about them through science and through photography, the better off we will all be.\"\n\nTo learn more about the science and exploration supported by the nonprofit National Geographic Society, visit http://natgeo.org/grants. \n\nRead about Brian Skerry\nhttp://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/brian-skerry-bio/\n\nSee Brian Skerry at work in the gorgeous Cortes Bank waters.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i6VSrIYRYY\n\nWatch more videos of National Geographic explorers in the field. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLivjPDlt6ApQwXq3U8A7Y3HAWPajyXOIQ\n\nVideo Producer: Nora Rappaport\nVideo Editor: Dave Nathan\nSeries Producer: Chris Mattle\nAdditional Footage: Eric Savetsky\n\nGreat White Shark Photo Shoot: Don't Try This At Home | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/NZTNcqBDE8o\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-03-15T12:00:04.000Z"},{"id":"059_PSt50cY","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/059_PSt50cY/0.jpg","title":"Are These the Oldest Fossils Ever Found? | National Geographic","description":"New fossil evidence may represent the most ancient life ever discovered.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Scientists from University College London have analyzed the rocks containing these structures and found chemical signatures indicating biological processes. Along with the structural complexity of the tubes, the chemical evidence suggests that these are the remains of very ancient microorganisms. The age of the rocks is controversial, but if the outside estimate is correct, and the samples are indeed fossils, they would be well over 4 billion years old. By implication, life would then have arisen even earlier, relatively soon after the formation of the planet. The findings would point to a higher likelihood of life on other worlds.\n\nREAD: New evidence suggests life on Earth may have arisen more than 4 billion years ago.\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/03/oldest-life-earth-iron-fossils-canada-vents-science/\n\nAre These the Oldest Fossils Ever Found? | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/059_PSt50cY\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-03-08T18:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"uFrkcHlwXOg","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/uFrkcHlwXOg/0.jpg","title":"How Scientists and Citizens Are Protecting Ancient Ruins in Peru | National Geographic","description":"Pachacamac is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the longest inhabited ancient settlements in the Americas.

She is committed to protecting the site from all threats to the important cultural heritage. Since 2014, she has worked and partnered with the Sustainable Preservation Initiative (SPI) to ensure a socially responsible approach to protecting the site. SPI is a global not-for-profit organization that creates economic opportunity and stability by giving communities around archaeological sites the tools to be self-reliant, leveraging their historic sites responsibly and freeing them to thrive. The result: the preservation of our collective legacy. SPI’s programs focus on providing local residents, primarily women, with business and artisan skills so they benefit from Pachacamac’s tourism, and therefore rely on its preservation. SPI and the museum organized a group of local women who came together from the area surrounding Pachacamac. These women have formed an organization that they control and run themselves called Sisan (“flowering” in the local Quechua language) where they create and sell products related to the site’s cultural history and iconography. Their business is profitable and self-sustaining, and they are proud defenders of Pachacamac. The Pachacamac Site Museum has a store where artisanal products made by the group and other SPI projects around Peru are sold. \n\nThe SPI program not only an economic but also a social hub for disadvantaged women from surrounding communities. Pozzi-Escot says, “To see the way the women—who came here some years ago and were so timid—feel about themselves and have become empowered is an important achievement. For them, SPI and the Pachacamac Site Museum truly means improving their quality of life and it also means knowing who they are and where they want to go.”\n\nPachacamac is the most visited site on the central Peruvian coast, and the staff also hosts community and educational programs. For example, children come and learn about archaeological preservation, native plants, and how to make adobe for conserving the ancient architecture. \n\n“I think what makes me most happy is knowing that the people here feel like they are a part of their own history and of Pachacamac,” says Pozzi-Escot. “That is the most important thing.” Pozzi-Escot knows that their activities at the museum and with SPI are connecting cultural heritage to the present-day lives of local people, giving locals a way to better their lives and protect the site from destruction. “One of the satisfactions I have in my work is knowing that we will no longer need the intervention of the police to protect this site,” she said. Only the efforts of those whose lives rely on the preservation of Pachacamac can ensure its existence for the future. \n\nLearn about SISAN and the Sustainable Preservation Initiative (SPI)\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sisan.museo.pachacamac/ \nhttp://www.sustainablepreservation.org \n\nRead about space archaeology http://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/space-archaeology/\n\nGlobalXplorer° is a cutting-edge platform that empowers citizen scientists around the world to help reduce looting and encroachment at important archaeological sites—as well as discover and protect unknown sites—using satellite imagery.

They’ve focused on a large complex of pyramids called Chotuna-Chornancap, which was built by the Sicán, also known as Lambayeque, around A.D. 750. The pyramids were a seat of power for at least three civilizations: the Sicán, Chimú, and Inca. The latest major discoveries at Chotuna-Chornancap included the tomb of a priestess who was buried with a gold crown, silver jewelry, and a scepter. “We found the tomb of an elite member of the Lambayeque culture who represents one of the most important rulers we’ve known in this area,” says Wester. \n\nCastillo and Wester are confident that there are decades more of archaeological discoveries to be made at the site, and there is a sense of urgency. “Are we in a hurry? Yes,” Castillo says. “Damage by water, looting, and encroachment are the biggest threat to archaeological sites all around the world,” says Castillo. Hundreds of sites have already been lost. Many of these sites may be small, but Castillo explains why they are still important to preserve: “The problem is that if we go this way, we will end up only having Machu Picchu and maybe Chan Chan and a couple of other very large sites. We want to know how the peasants lived. We want to know how agricultural fields were. We want to answer questions that go beyond how the rich and powerful were enjoying life.” \n\nToday, technologies such as drones make it possible to survey large areas in a short amount of time, and even build models to assess possible site damage. Castillo received a grant from the National Geographic Society to use aerial photography to document El Niño's impacts on archaeological structures such as Chotuna-Chornancap on the north coast of Peru. Using high-resolution, photogrammetric 3-D models to create digital topography allows him to record and assess the extension, duration, and pace of El Niño's heavy rains and floods. Predicting how the water is going to flow makes it possible to try to divert it to protect archaeological sites. “The technical pictures that we can produce can help us do things we've never done before,” Castillo explained. Not only are they able to lay out their excavation units to get a useful bird’s-eye view and produce 3-D models of the excavations themselves, “we realized that the models and the pictures could actually allow us to help preserve the sites much better,” Castillo says. \n\nThere are many reasons why it’s important to study and preserve the past. Both Castillo and Wester are motivated by how archaeology can contribute to present and future society. Wester expressed, “The past must become a tool to improve the present, and if we don’t do this, then we are only looking for treasures, and that is not the purpose of archaeology,” says Wester. \n\nGlobalXplorer° is a cutting-edge platform that empowers citizen scientists around the world to help reduce looting and encroachment at important archaeological sites—as well as discover and protect unknown sites—using satellite imagery.

Through their world-class scientists, photographers, journalists, and filmmakers, Nat Geo gets you closer to the stories that matter and past the edge of what's possible.\n\nAs conservationists and National Geographic Big Cat Initiative grantees, the van Vuurens are on the frontlines of human-wildlife conflict and have translocated more than a hundred big cats in less than a decade in order to mitigate that conflict. Watch the video to see how one epic leopard translocation unfolds.\n \nNational Geographic also sat down with the couple at their wildlife sanctuary to talk about their work.\n \nNational Geographic: How did you get started in conservation work?\n \nMarlice: When we started N/a’an ku sê Wildlife Sanctuary ten years ago, we got in cheetahs and leopards, and we realized we could not only take animals in, we had to deal with the source of the problem. Farmers normally would catch cheetahs and leopards with capture cages the minute they start losing livestock to the carnivores. \n \nNational Geographic: How does your Rapid Response Unit get involved?\n \nRudie: The first prize for us is to release that animal on the spot, if we can convince the farmer that this is not really a problem animal and that it's an opportunistic livestock raider. Second prize for us would be if the farmer agrees that we collar and release the animal there and then. The collar has a satellite unit and we can see exactly where the animal is. We share that with the farmer and he often shares that with his neighbors. He starts seeing how these animals move, we inform him when we see a kill pattern on the downloads, and ask him to go and look at what is the prey that that animal caught, is it natural prey or is it livestock? This is how we engage with the farmers and how we work with them. Farmers are some of the best conservationists in this country. One of our last resorts is to translocate that animal to a protected area.\n \nNational Geographic: Why is there such high likelihood of having big cats on farmland in Namibia?\n \nRudie: Cheetahs and leopards in Namibia occur mostly outside of protected areas, and that is mostly commercial farmland, so the chances of conflict are very high. When we talk about human-wildlife conflict we always look at the wildlife side of things, but there's a human component.\n \nMarlice: Remember, we are both Namibian. We have our own cattle here, our own sheep, and our own goats. We practice what we preach. We come there as a farmer and somebody that just wants to help. We don't want to tell you what you're doing wrong, we come with options.\n \nNational Geographic: Why should someone across the world somewhere—who may never see a leopard in the wild—care about this?\n \nRudie: If we lose these carnivores, it will have severe effects to the ecosystem. If carnivores disappear from our ecosystem, baboon numbers will go through the roof. If baboon numbers go through the roof, disease transmission between baboons and humans can increase and we could have another disease that could influence the whole world, and people will trace it back to Africa because leopards disappeared. I don't think people realize what the impact is if we lose a species. Everybody is at the disadvantage, not only the people that love them.\n \nFor more on big cats, tune in to Big Cat Week, premiering Monday, Feb. 20, at 9/8c on Nat Geo WILD and learn more about the National Geographic Big Cats Initiative, a global initiative that supports scientists and conservationists working to save big cats in the wild.\nhttp://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/big-cats-initiative/\n \nLearn more about the science and exploration supported by the nonprofit National Geographic Society at http://natgeo.org/grants.\n \nSENIOR PRODUCER: Sarah Joseph\nPRODUCER/EDITOR: Nora Rappaport\n\nRescuing a Fierce Leopard: See What It Takes | Expedition Raw\nhttps://youtu.be/NYeEmlCZ29o\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-02-10T18:00:03.000Z"},{"id":"rdHrKI7Pxy4","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/rdHrKI7Pxy4/0.jpg","title":"A Mysterious Sinking | Lawless Oceans","description":"Something is fishy about the demise of the massacre’s main shooting ship, the Ping Shin 101.  \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Watch all clips of Lawless Oceans here: http://bit.ly/WatchLawlessOceans\n➡ LAWLESS OCEANS AIRS TUESDAYS 9/8c.\n\nAbout Lawless Oceans:\nOver six gripping episodes Karsten von Hoesslin investigates a murder at sea and reveals the shocking extent of maritime crime from drugs to piracy.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Biological anthropologist and National Geographic Emerging Explorer Marina Elliott ventured a hundred feet deep into an ancient cave, at times squeezing through passages only eight inches wide, to recover the remains of what turned out to be a newly discovered, extinct human ancestor.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Watch all clips of Expedition Raw here: http://bit.ly/WatchmoreExpeditionRaw\n➡ Get More Expedition Raw on Youtube: http://bit.ly/NGExpeditionRaw\n\nAbout Expedition Raw:\nSurprises, challenges, and amazing behind-the-scenes moments captured by National Geographic explorers in the field.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nWorking with expedition leader and National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Lee Berger, Elliott led an excavation team into Rising Star Cave, where cavers had previously come across unidentified bones. Elliott expected a relatively quick job of retrieving fossils belonging to a single individual but \"when I first started looking into that space, my headlamp was picking up flashes of bone just here and there and everywhere,\" she recalls. \"We recovered around 1,500 fragments from that first expedition, in an area smaller than a child's sandbox.\" Upon examination, the scientists determined that the fossils belong to the human genus—but not to a species already known to science.\n\nThe discovery of our new but extinct family member Homo naledi—named after Rising Star Cave, as naledi means \"star\" in a local South African language—is turning our understanding of our past on its head just a bit. Homo naledi appears to be one of the most primitive known species in the human genus, with a small brain and ape-like features. But H. naledi also has some more humanlike features that distinguish it from any other known early human ancestors. It has curved fingers good for climbing, feet and legs suited for long-distance walking, and H. naledi may have even engaged in ritualized behavior.\n\n\"There's a lot of books about human origins and human evolution. For a long time, I think we thought we sort of wrapped it up. What Homo naledi has done is kind of forced a whole scale rethink of that. The family tree that we always think about, and have been adding little twigs and branches to along the way, actually may be a lot bushier than we ever really realized. In fact, that whole tree analogy may not be a good analogy at all. A lot of these branches actually rejoined each other and became something else. The relationships of past species and past populations is a lot more complicated than we had originally assumed.\n\n\"We have 15 individuals, ranging in age from neonates to older adults. The whole assemblage is something that we didn't think we'd ever get in paleoanthropology. We're used to dealing with very small scraps of material. What this is doing is a real wake up call to the discipline,\" says Elliott.\n\nBut how did so many of our ancestors end up in the underground labyrinth? \"Really, there's no other explanation than they were deliberately deposited there. Whether they were dragged all the way in or whether they were sort of tumbled in is another question,\" Elliott says, musing on the possibility of ritualized behavior. It's actually a lack of evidence that leads scientists to believe our ancestors were purposely placed in Rising Star. \"We have no buck, or deer, no ungulates in there, not a baboon bone, not a porcupine, none of these species that often frequent caves in the first place, are in there. We have no signs of carnivore activity on the bones. Even if there had been an opening from above, such as a sink hole, there are very few sink holes that selectively kill only one species.\" Elliott explains.\n\nWhile Homo naledi may be the discovery of a lifetime—or perhaps, many lifetimes—Rising Star may hold yet more clues to our ancient past. \"The space that we excavated is only maybe a tenth of the surface of that chamber floor,\" says Elliott.  \"There's a lot more material to recover. It's going to be decades of work.\" Elliott is leading those ongoing excavations.\n\nRead more about the discovery of Homo naledi: http://bit.ly/humanevolutionchange\nhttp://bit.ly/extractlatestfossil\n\nMarina Elliott is a grantee of National Geographic's Expeditions Council.\nhttp://bit.ly/explorersgrants\nhttp://bit.ly/marinaelliott\n\nTo learn more about the science and exploration supported by the nonprofit National Geographic Society, visit http://natgeo.org/grants.\n\nVIDEO PRODUCER/EDITOR: Nora Rappaport\nSERIES PRODUCER: Chris Mattle\nASSOCIATE PRODUCER: Elaina Kimes\n\nSqueezing Through Rocky Caves to Find Ancient Skeletons | Expedition Raw\nhttps://youtu.be/3gXccaU4E0o\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-02-01T18:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"jS9GK9KGFxA","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/jS9GK9KGFxA/0.jpg","title":"Stunning Cave Photography Illuminates an Unseen World | Nat Geo Live","description":"The first time National Geographic photographer Robbie Shone stepped foot in a cave, he was hooked.

Through their world-class scientists, photographers, journalists, and filmmakers, Nat Geo gets you closer to the stories that matter and past the edge of what's possible.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nJoin NG underwater photographer Brian Skerry in the vibrant waters of Cortes Bank and prepare for a sensory overload. \"For me, diving in Cortes Bank is like diving into an underwater kaleidoscope,\" says Skerry. \"It is this fanciful, almost surreal place where green grass sways in a wavelike formation, and what appear to be palm trees are growing out of the seafloor. You’ve got bat rays and stingrays that are feeding down in that surf grass with dolphins overhead. It really is like swimming through the pages of a storybook in a 'Seuss-ical' sort of way, and with every dive you’re meeting this fascinating cast of characters. It’s really quite stunning and unlike anything else I’ve seen.\"\n\nRare northern right whale dolphins, Pacific white-sided dolphins, Pacific torpedo rays, sea lions, and harbor seals are just some of the wildlife that call Cortes Bank home. They elegantly maneuver through the cartoonish sea plants undulating with colors so bright and lively that they may as well have been plucked from the pages of a children's book. But words can’t quite do the exquisite nature of Cortes Bank justice, so Skerry tried to capture it in photographs.\n\n\"Cortes Bank has remained somewhat unspoiled due to its remoteness, being a hundred miles offshore of California, and the weather can be quite nasty out there, but Cortes Bank currently has zero protection. So I want to make photographs that will compel readers to first know about this place and then hopefully have a desire to want to protect it,\" Skerry says.\n\nDue to El Niño, Cortes Bank has fallen victim to warming waters. The change in temperature is killing off the region's giant kelp, which is an integral part of a healthy ecosystem for the area’s diverse marine life. As part of National Geographic's film, Sea of Hope, premiering January 15, 2017, Skerry is working with scientists to document rare marine ecosystems in United States waters, highlighting their beauty, wildlife, and need for protection. \n\n\"Being an underwater photographer is quite different than the work that my terrestrial counterparts do. I can't go to a remote place, sit in a blind for a month and use 600 mm lens while waiting for an elusive animal to wander by and make those pictures,\" says Skerry. \"All nature photography is very difficult and has its own unique challenges, but I can only stay underwater as long as the air supply on my back will last. I have to get very close to my subjects, even in the places where the water is the clearest I usually have to make pictures within a couple of meters of my subjects. I have to be able to light them and that is really a testimony to the animals that allow me into their world.\"\n\nSkerry has spent some 10,000 hours underwater, bringing images of the marine world back to those of us on land. \"I've been diving for over three decades and I've put myself in some pretty crazy places, but I think having a degree of fear has kept me alive. If the conditions don't seem right or if you're in the presence of an animal that isn't behaving the way you would expect, you get that sort of primal sense and it's important to listen to that and get out of the water. I've been lost under arctic ice, I've been chased by sperm whales or chased out of the water by sharks. I drifted off the coast of Ireland for two and a half hours when the dive boat never saw me and I was picked up ultimately by a fishing boat,\" says Skerry, recounting some of his closer-calls. \"I try to be cautious and listen to that little voice inside of me, and I have no qualms about standing down if a particular day just doesn't seem right, and you live to fight another day.\"\n\nCheck out the National Geographic film \"Sea Of Hope: America's Underwater Treasures.\" http://bit.ly/SeaofHope\n\nBrian Skerry is a grantee of National Geographic's Expeditions Council. http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/grants-programs/expeditions-council/\nTo learn more about the science and exploration supported by the nonprofit National Geographic Society, visit http://natgeo.org/grants.\n\nVIDEO PRODUCER/EDITOR: Nora Rappaport\nSERIES PRODUCER: Chris Mattle\nIMAGES: Brian Skerry\nCINEMATOGRAPHER: Johnny Friday\n\nDive Into an “Underwater Kaleidoscope” of Unbelievable Beauty | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/4i6VSrIYRYY\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-01-18T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"QGTr7sgRwnw","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/QGTr7sgRwnw/0.jpg","title":"In Ancient Egypt, Even Boats Had Their Own Tombs | National Geographic","description":"Archaeologists recently discovered an ancient Egyptian boat burial site dating more than 3,800 years old.

The U.S.S. Arizona has been resting on the seafloor of Pearl Harbor for 75 years. Now, portions of the sunken battleship, including second and third decks, have been inventoried and sampled for the first time by the National Park Service utilizing a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) engineered by Marine Imaging Technologies and the Advanced Imaging and Visualization Laboratory at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Low levels of dissolved oxygen in the water deep within the ship's interior cabins, combined with a protective covering of marine encrustations on the hull, have helped preserve the ship and its contents.\n\nRead more about the remarkable preservation of the U.S.S.

Would you trudge across a snowy volcano with a hundred pounds of gear thrown over your shoulder? Would you trek by yourself across a giant river oft visited by grizzly bears? Would you stake out in the dark wilderness with the howls of wolves getting closer and closer? Conservation photographer Ronan Donovan did all that and more for a year and a half to photograph Yellowstone National Park and the wolves that call it home.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Yellowstone National Park granted and governed National Geographic and Donovan’s access to these restricted areas as part of a larger effort to highlight research being conducted in the park.\n\n\"One iffy experience I had outside of Yellowstone National Park,\" Donovan recalls, \"was when a pack of 14 wolves had been howling but I didn't know exactly where they were.  Sunset ends up coming so I'm about to hike out when I see a little saw-whet owl, this tiny little teacup owl that's super cute and hard to find and hilarious. There's a pair of them tooting back and forth so I start photographing them for an hour and I lose track of time. All of a sudden it's pitch dark, so I decide it's time to go.\n\n\"I hear these wolves up on the hillside maybe 300 feet away playing with each other, yipping and snarling, and I think, oh that's pretty cool, I'm listening to wolves in the darkness. And then I start to hear legs brushing through grass and I realize the wolves are really close.\n\n\"I turn the headlight on and there's three black wolves in the beam of light, frozen staring right at me. They look at me and then they erupt and run away because they're super scared of people. I was never scared for myself necessarily, but you never want to startle an animal. And then as I'm hiking out, the wolves are all howling to each other because it's a social bonding thing. When they get scared or nervous, they come together and howl and it makes them feel better.\"\n\nAs one of six photographers in Yellowstone for National Geographic magazine's special issue on America's oldest park, Donovan said his goal was to \"shed light on the way wolves interact in their natural landscape. A lot of times wolves get persecuted and this was an opportunity for me to just show wolves for what they were, for being large, beautiful, megafauna carnivores.\" For Donovan, the photograph he made of three wolves feasting on a bison carcass (00:25) captured the essence of Yellowstone's wolves.\n\n\"This photo is of three wolves on a carcass in the wintertime along the Yellowstone River. It's a family group—alpha females on the right and her two yearlings in the middle—and one of the wolves is looking straight at the camera. That wolf pack, Mollie's wolf pack, it's the oldest pack in Yellowstone and they are big, beautiful, wild wolves in the sense that they live in the back country and they don't see people very often. They're as close to a true gray wolf as you can get in the lower 48 states, and that picture to me was one of my favorite images from the whole project.\"\n\nDonovan continues, \"There's this total hidden side to Yellowstone that is essentially as close as we can get to a pre-colonial North America. Since Yellowstone's creation a hundred-plus years ago, the megafauna—the bison, the elk, the wolves, the grizzlies—they are at their highest numbers. Yellowstone's the world's first national park, and it's doing better than it was when it was created, which is fantastic.\"\n \nLearn more about Donovan’s experience in Yellowstone.\nhttp://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/05/yellowstone-photographer-donovan/\nhttp://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/05/\n\nRonan Donovan is a grantee of National Geographic’s Expeditions Council. \nhttp://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/grants-programs/expeditions-council/\n\nTo learn more about the science and exploration supported by the nonprofit National Geographic Society, visit http://natgeo.org/grants.\n\nPRODUCER/EDITOR: Nora Rappaport\nSERIES PRODUCER: Chris Mattle\nFOOTAGE/IMAGES: Ronan Donovan\n\nA Man Among Wolves: Photographing Yellowstone’s Iconic Predators | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/W8Q7NbmQVGA\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-01-04T13:00:04.000Z"},{"id":"D8vgfl_rKn8","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/D8vgfl_rKn8/0.jpg","title":"Watch This Daring Highwire Walk Through a Deep Underground Cave | National Geographic","description":"In a cave deep beneath the French Alps, German wire walker Lukas Irmler this summer led a team of French cavers and slackliners to an otherworldly site around 500 yards underground.

He was a forerunner in the study of high-altitude archaeology, the research of sites at 17,000 feet and above. Focusing on ancient peoples and their cultures, Reinhard’s trips regularly take him up mountains, underwater, and deep into jungles. On expeditions to the Andes Mountains in Peru, he’s found Inca artifacts that are so well-preserved, they look brand new. He and his team also discovered something in the 1990s that you don’t find out in the field just any old day: frozen Inca mummies. The mummies, left as human sacrifices some 500 years ago, were almost perfectly preserved. His venture has since led to more than a dozen frozen Inca human sacrifices found across five mountains in the Andes! Reinhard’s exploration and discovery of the Inca artifacts was a first, as the sites had been virtually inaccessible before then due to the high altitudes. \n\nYou might call Reinhard an “explorer’s explorer” – he isn’t just going out and studying places that other explorers have already covered. As a high-altitude archaeologist, Reinhard sets his sights on new, uncharted territory and discovers historical treasures for the very first time.\n\nCredits:\nSERIES PRODUCER: Chris Mattle\nPRODUCER/EDITOR: Katy Daily\nASSOCIATE PRODUCER: Jared M.

It’s a question Maritza Morales Casanova, an environmentalist and Rolex Young Laureate from Yucatán, Mexico, has spent her life working to answer. Morales Casanova established Ceiba Pentandra Park, what she calls a theme park of sorts in Yucatán designed to teach students all about environmental issues.\n \n“A normal school in Mexico has no environmental education,” Morales Casanova says. As such, Ceiba Pentandra is no normal school: It’s a free, interactive, and fun experience, where young visitors learn all about climate change, wetland conservation, pollution, and wildlife. Morales Casanova leads them in examining small animal species, planting and tending to soil, and playing games.\n \nSeeing her Yucatán community in peril initially fueled her passion for environmentalism. A lack of environmental awareness is a huge problem in Mexico, and Yucatán is a hot spot for resource degradation. Morales Casanova looks to children—she calls them the best teachers in the world and the next heroes of \"Grandmother Earth\"—to change the future.\n \n“Their hands may be small but their hearts are immense,” she says. \n\nHer next goal? To take Ceiba Pentandra’s curriculum to other interested schools around the world.\n\nPRODUCER/EDITOR: Katy Daily \nSENIOR PRODUCERS: Chris Mattle and Mike Olcott\nASSOCIATE PRODUCER: Jared M.

Designed to last for 90 days, Spirit lasted almost six years, and Opportunity's still communicating with us almost 12 years later. It's like your children. You expected them to go off and get a college degree, but not only did they get a college degree, they got a Ph.D., and then they got the Nobel Prize.\"\n\nNot unlike having children, Boykins and the rest of the rover team must invest in the spacecraft for years, only to send them off and hope they do OK. \"Mars Curiosity, as part of the Mars Science Laboratory, took about eight years to develop. Then once we launched it, it took about eight and a half months to reach Mars,\" Boykins recalls. \"Once launch happens, as a mechanical engineer you're not going to touch the rover anymore. Now what's going to happen is the vehicle is going to do the thing that you designed it to do, which is explore the surface of Mars and give us information that will tell a story like, there was once water on Mars. There is an inhabitable place. There are places on Mars that, if life started, life would be able to be sustained because all of the biological material, all the fundamental building blocks are there.'\n\nThat is in fact the story that Curiosity is beginning to tell. The rover, for which Boykins built the actuators, has found signs of water on Mars. \"Wherever we find water, we find life,\" says Boykins, believing there's a good chance we'll find life on Mars. \"We're probably not going to find high-order life, i.e., you or me. There's probably not going to be aliens running around. What we'll most likely find is blue-green algae. Pond scum. This is the stuff that appears in your aquarium or your fish tank. Maybe a microorganism. Maybe.\"\n\nSo why get excited about pond scum? You don't have to ask Boykins twice: \"We should be excited about finding algae because we would be able to say that life is not unique to Earth. If we found something that started as blue-green algae, that's the beginning of what happened here on Earth,\" Boykins explains. \"But for me, a lot of the exploration of Mars is not about having a lifeboat to go and live there, but understanding the evolution of the planet and saying, 'Can we figure out what happened on the surface of Mars to cause life to not currently be there?' And how can we apply that knowledge to what's going on here on Earth so that we understand how to protect our own planet?\"\n\nBoykins is currently developing instruments that will be on board the next Mars rover, launching in the year 2020.\n\nCheck out other jobs that go beyond the cubicle in the rest of our digital series Best Job Ever, and learn about science and exploration supported by the nonprofit National Geographic Society at http://natgeo.org/grants\n\nPRODUCER/EDITOR: Nora Rappaport\nSERIES PRODUCER: Chris Mattle\nASSOCIATE PRODUCERS: Jared Gair and Elaina Kimes\n\nHe Builds Space Robots for a Living | Best Job Ever\nhttps://youtu.be/X_7QkQCHezc\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-11-09T18:00:01.000Z"},{"id":"3nZ4GTi7AK0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/3nZ4GTi7AK0/0.jpg","title":"This Island’s Rare Coastal Wolves Could Be In Danger | National Geographic","description":"Why are the coastal wolves of Vancouver Island so elusive?\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

While exploring the cave, Alvarez found a skull, \"and all of a sudden,\" as Nava recounts, \"we discover the most complete, and the oldest human remains ever found in the Americas.\"\n\nLed by Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History and supported by the National Geographic Society, Nava and an international group of scientists have spent years working to protect, recover, and study the skeleton. \"We have an intact cranium. We have all her teeth. We have most of her vertebra, most of her ribs, all her limbs. We have the pelvis, and we have the pubic bone. It's just amazing,\" Nava says in wonderment.\n\n\"I feel proud of the discovery and we're all happy that we did it, but at the same time it's become this responsibility of seeing the site protected, seeing the research and the science done so that we can actually unravel all the secrets of Hoyo Negro,\" Nava says. \"We're the first ones to interact with whatever is left of this human that lived during the last ice age.\"\n\nThat human was a teenage girl who lived about 13,000 years ago, before the cave was underwater. The Hoyo Negro team has affectionately dubbed her \"Naia,\" after the water nymphs in ancient Greek mythology. \"One of the researchers said, 'Okay, we got to give it a name,'\" Nava remembers. \"Because it becomes a different relationship. Now you're not talking about an 'it,' you're not talking about bone, you're talking about a person.\" And Nava thinks about the human element of the discovery frequently.\n\n\"For me, when we go in these caves, we think that we're doing this great exploration, but in reality the original explorers of these tunnels were Naia and her people. We're just following them 13,000 years later. I just imagine the conditions they were living in at that time. This is a deserted area and they're going in there and having to find water and food and shelter and fight animals,\" Nava says, wondering just how Naia found her final resting place in Hoyo Negro. \"Hoyo Negro and Naia have become an integral part of my life, part of my story.\"\n\nTurns out, Naia is part of a lot of Americans' stories, or at least their histories. Scientists were able to extract ancient, intact DNA from one of Naia's teeth, determining her DNA matches that of modern Native Americans. This suggests that the earliest Americans migrated from Siberia via a now nonexistent land bridge, and any physical differences among populations are due to natural changes that occurred after humans arrived in the Americas, and not from having migrated from multiple locations in Europe and Asia, as some anthropologists previously thought.\n\n\"The discoveries that we're making inside the cave in the Yucatán Peninsula give us a view of how life used to be and it gives you a sense of how small our existence is compared to what the planet has gone through, to what humans have gone through,\" says Nava. \"For me, Hoyo Negro and Naia are the stars of this project, and we all work to bring their stories light so we understand a little bit better about where do we come from.\"\n\nAlberto Nava is a grantee of National Geographic's Expeditions Council. http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/grants-programs/expeditions-council/\n \nTo learn more about the science and exploration supported by the nonprofit National Geographic Society, visit http://natgeo.org/grants and be sure to check out more explorers in action in our digital series, Expedition Raw. \n\nVIDEO PRODUCER/EDITOR: Nora Rappaport\nASSOCIATE PRODUCER: Jared Gair\nSERIES PRODUCER: Chris Mattle\n\nGiant Underwater Cave Was Hiding Oldest Human Skeleton in the Americas | Expedition Raw\nhttps://youtu.be/YhVhrC5XuAc\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-11-02T17:00:02.000Z"},{"id":"TlwflbXhK70","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/TlwflbXhK70/0.jpg","title":"What’s Special About a Wolf’s Paw Print? | National Geographic","description":"Wolf paws leave behind more than just a print on the ground.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Through their world-class scientists, photographers, journalists, and filmmakers, Nat Geo gets you closer to the stories that matter and past the edge of what's possible.\n\nThis week’s Expedition Raw catches up with Bertie Gregory, wildlife filmmaker and National Geographic Young Explorer who has traveled to Vancouver Island in British Columbia for three months on assignment. His series, wild_life with bertie gregory, showcases his encounters with beautiful, enigmatic creatures such as bears, eagles, and sea otters. We at home are treated to the finest few minutes of his footage every week, so it’s easy to forget the countless number of hours Bertie and his team simply wait around, preparing for nature to happen so they can nail the shot. \n\nBertie's most recent outing had him more excited to see rainfall than he had ever been in his career: the downpour on Vancouver Island meant that river levels were rising, which meant more and more salmon were swimming through to lay their eggs. More salmon, Bertie knew, meant more natural predators out and about to feed on them. More natural predators meant bears! Bertie set up multiple cameras—some on land, an action camera on a log in the water—ready to capture gripping footage of a bear snapping up salmon in its teeth. Although plenty of bears did wander in and out of the forest to grab a fishy meal on the river, Bertie was having a tough time landing the killer shot. Even so, he wasn’t frustrated; in fact, the waiting appeared to be just as exciting for Bertie as the payoff. \n\n“When I tell people one of my favorite things to do is sit in a river all day, in an icy cold river waist deep, with stinking, dead salmon carcasses everywhere, waiting for a bear to turn up, they might think I'm a bit strange,” said Bertie, “but that is one of the things that I love doing.”\n\nBertie’s patience was rewarded. He had initially spotted a female bear lingering around where his action camera was perched. She came close as she scoped out the river, but always kept just a little bit out of frame. Bertie waited for nearly two hours, and finally the bear positioned herself front and center, snapping up a salmon right in front of the camera lens.\n\n“One of the cool things, when you nail a shot, is that not only have you just seen something incredible, but you've also captured it,” said Bertie. “Often, it's really difficult because you see something amazing, but it doesn't quite come together for the filming or the photography ... you're a little bit annoyed with yourself. Maybe you've missed it. When everything does come together, it's like, ‘Yeah.’”\n\nYeah is an understatement. Bertie may be out on assignment to teach us about ecology and animals, not necessarily to share life lessons and sage advice. But watching his quest to film Vancouver Island’s most charismatic animals has definitely taught me a thing or two: namely, how important it is to stay the course even when the going is tough, to prepare yourself for whatever might happen, and above all, to be patient.\n\nVideo Producer/Editor: Monica Pinzon\nSeries Producer: Chris Mattle\nFootage: Bertie Gregory\nAssociate Producer: Jared M.

By alerting the bears to their presence, the pair greatly reduced their chance of being attacked.  “They hear us, and there's carnage outside. They're scrapping around, they're running in all directions, and then everything goes quiet.\n\n“I unzip the tent, slowly, and there's nothing to see. When I turn around to go back toward the tent, I glance up,” he says. Two feet from the tent stands a tree with the two black bear cubs that Gregory had been tracking just days earlier. “I have two things in my head. The first thing is, Awww, that is the cutest thing ever,\" he says. Then he moved on to practical matters. \"We need to back off here to make sure that the mum can come in and take those cubs down.” Gregory, who has found himself often in the presence of bears, asked Skinner to calmly exit the tent.\n\n\"I'm saying, Becca, come, bring that,\" by which he meant to bring the camera. “Becca thought I was pointing at the bear spray. I was like, No, no, we don't need that, give me the camera.\"\n\nEncounters with wild animals are routine for Gregory. “I think people assume that that's a scary experience, but I've been lucky to have been mentored by some people that know how to act around bears. With black bears, you give them space. I like to talk to them in a very calm voice, so they know where you are, especially in the dark. When they're surprised, that's when there's a potentially dangerous encounter.” He notes that female bears can be particularly protective of their cubs and may react aggressively if they feel they are in danger.\n\nSkinner left the tent with a camera. Minutes later, the female bear returned. “The first one came down pretty quick. The second one was much more nervous,” Gregory says. “As long as I'm not getting in between the mum and her cubs, or I'm not threatening the safety of the cubs in the eyes of the mother, it's not a dangerous encounter.”\n\nClimbing trees is essential for these animals. Cubs often use trees as a defense mechanism to hide from adult male bears who want to kill them in order to produce offspring of their own. “Their safe place is up a tree,” Gregory says.\n\nBritish Columbia has one of the densest populations of black bears in the world. “Bears are around our camp all of the time. We know that from the tracks, we see them every now and again. We also keep our food up a tree to make sure we don't have any problems with them, but I never expected to have a bear encounter quite as close as this one,” Gregory says.\n\n“It was funny because it was completely out of the blue, and those are the kinds of moments that you remember. It's not the slogging down the beach with 50 pounds of gear on your back, or wading through an icy cold river, or staying up into the night. It's the chance encounters that you could never plan, that you could never script—they're the things that stay with you.”\n\nGregory is a 2015 National Geographic Scientific Exploration Society Zenith Explorer, National Geographic Young Explorer, Youth Outdoor Photographer of the Year, wildlife photographer, filmmaker, and host of wild_life with bertie gregory.\nhttp://nationalgeographic.org/\n\nFor more on Gregory, check out National Geographic’s first digital series, wild_life with bertie gregory.

They were on an expedition to investigate deep-ocean creatures that exist hundreds of meters below the surface alongside plankton. Unfortunately, a harsh storm hit on the evening of May 2, several miles off the coast, and the engineers lost their Driftcams out to sea. Three years later, the engineering team was contacted by a Frenchman sailing across the Atlantic. Each year, Eric Visage travels from the Caribbean to his home in France accompanied by his little dog, Scuba. “My dog began to bark, and we saw this ball.”  Visage had recovered one of the Driftcams—thousands of miles from where it had originally been deployed.\n\nTo learn more about the science and exploration supported by the nonprofit National Geographic Society, visit http://natgeo.org/grants.\n\nCredits:\nSeries Producer: Chris Mattle\nFootage: Alan Turchik, Christina Shepard, Dave McAloney, Eric Berkenpas, Pristine Seas\nAssociate Producer: Elaina Kimes\nVideo Producer/Editor: Monica Pinzon\n\nHow a Tiny Dog Saved a National Geographic Expedition | Expedition Raw\nhttps://youtu.be/CKN-mLfkqi4\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-09-15T12:00:01.000Z"},{"id":"mMIn72kq4kw","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/mMIn72kq4kw/0.jpg","title":"Black Bears Are Better Tree Climbers Than You—Here’s Why | National Geographic","description":"How can bears climb trees so well?\nWatch new episodes of wild_life with Bertie Gregory on Wednesdays at http://natgeowild.com/wild/wildlife.\nIn Nat Geo WILD’s first digital series, wildlife filmmaker Bertie Gregory journeys to the Pacific Northwest in search of the elusive coastal wolves that inhabit one of the last places on the planet where a wild forest meets a wild ocean.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Hint: It's on a volcano. Evolutionary biologist and National Geographic grantee Borja Milá and fellow biologist Christophe Thébaud traveled to Réunion, a volcanic island in the southern Indian Ocean, in hopes of figuring out the big evolutionary story behind a tiny species of bird called the Mascarene gray white-eye.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Watch all clips of Expedition Raw here: http://bit.ly/WatchmoreExpeditionRaw\n➡ Get More Expedition Raw on Youtube: http://bit.ly/NGExpeditionRaw\n\nAbout Expedition Raw:\nSurprises, challenges, and amazing behind-the-scenes moments captured by National Geographic explorers in the field.\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure. Through their world-class scientists, photographers, journalists, and filmmakers, Nat Geo gets you closer to the stories that matter and past the edge of what's possible.\n\nIn order to study the birds, the scientists must catch them—or at the least see them. But Mother Nature had other plans for Milá’s team. On Christmas Eve, heavy tropical storms sent birds flying for cover and left the scientists confined to their tent atop the Piton de la Fournaise volcano. Since you won’t catch birds in the rain, the team decided to throw a makeshift Christmas Eve dinner instead. The duck cassoulet looked more like duck mush, and the follow-up course of peanuts from a bag wasn't much better.\n\nBut the explorers kept their spirits high in anticipation of the return of sunshine and dry weather, as Réunion Island is an ideal field laboratory to study the mysteries of evolution. On the nearby island of Mauritius, the Mascarene gray white-eye has only one plumage color form, yet on Réunion Island, which is only about 30 miles long, the bird has evolved into four distinct forms. Each form has a different plumage color, with barriers such as rivers, mountains, and lava flows separating them from each other.\n\nBut given that these birds can fly, what is preventing them from crossing the barriers and mating into one mixed form? Will the populations continue to evolve into completely different species? So far Milá, Thébaud, and the team's research is showing natural selection, sexual selection, and geographical barriers have varying degrees of impact in different regions on the island. As the study continues, the team hopes to answer larger questions about species formation and biodiversity. The scientists will return to Réunion Island in the spring of 2016 to continue their work; you can learn more about Milá's research on his website: http://borjamila.com/research/\n\nHow To Celebrate Christmas on a Volcano | Expedition Raw \nhttps://youtu.be/SPj7bCRFKco\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2015-12-17T19:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"ZWeyHfbs67w","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/ZWeyHfbs67w/0.jpg","title":"Alleged Miracle | Explorer","description":"Gianna Talone Sullivan began experiencing Mary in a deeply personal way.
