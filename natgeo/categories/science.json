But the HASEL muscle is created from plastic pouches, filled with an electrically insulated oil. The pouches are made of the same cheap material used in potato chip bags. When electrified, the liquid inside changes the shape of the muscle, simulating movement that is flexible yet strong. The hope is to create more human-like movements in robots, which could help in prosthetics and industrial applications.\n\nRead \"This Artificial Muscle Costs 10 Cents to Make.

On March 18, resident Eliud Njoroge Mbugua and his wife  noticed a crack in their floor. Within days, the house collapsed and was demolished, leaving Mbugua to salvage the remains. Seismic activity, coupled with heavy rain, led to the rapid split. The rainy season hit Kenya especially hard in mid-March, destabilizing the ash from a nearby volcano that had filled in the fissure. The volcanic soil is more easily washed away than the surrounding earth. As geologist David Adede explains, the crack reveals seismic instability. From the surface, the fault line’s exact location was indiscernible, until it was too late. \n\nRead more in \"Why This Giant Crack Opened Up In Kenya\"\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/east-african-great-rift-valley-crack-spd/\n\nWhat Made the Ground Split Open in Kenya? | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/X13ntFfwXqY\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-04-05T12:00:03.000Z"},{"id":"8E-QYtXm2Qw","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/8E-QYtXm2Qw/0.jpg","title":"U2 Spy Plane Flies Through a Dazzling Aurora | National Geographic","description":"Viewing an aurora from earth is amazing; flying into one is truly spectacular.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

They weigh very roughly the same as all of humanity. Army ants exhibit complex social behaviors that require group cooperation to achieve success. New footage shows how these ants build bridges with their bodies. The lead ant will slow down when it reaches a gap. The rest of the colony will continue to build the bridge with their bodies until the gap is closed. With brains that weigh less than one-millionth as much as a human brain, it is not surprising that these ants communicate using just 10 to 20 signals. Unlike human language, these messages are all instinctual.

For 15 years, marine biologist Stephen Kajiura of Florida Atlantic University has watched the blacktips’ journeys, monitoring population and locations through aerial photography and tracking tags. Kajiura's team has seen impressive numbers, including a single group of 15,000 sharks. But the migration count has dropped to a third of the norm. A stretch of the Atlantic from North Carolina to Maine has spiked in temperature, rising faster than 99 percent of ocean regions. Fish are sensitive to water temperature. An average rise of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit is enough to keep many blacktips in the northern waters. A sudden absence of a predator in Florida, and a sudden presence up the coast, can harm both ecosystems. Kajiura's goal is to restore the migrations.\n\nRead more in \"More Sharks Ditching Annual Migration as Ocean Warms\"\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/03/animals-sharks-oceans-global-warming\n\nWhy Fewer Blacktip Sharks Are Migrating to Florida | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/A2C38BrJLZ0\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-03-15T12:00:01.000Z"},{"id":"F29BJK5HZ1s","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/F29BJK5HZ1s/0.jpg","title":"The Making of Jane - Trailer | National Geographic","description":"Hear from Dr. Jane Goodall about her reaction to seeing her life captured on film in the award-winning documentary directed by Brett Morgen.  \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ JANE AIRS MONDAY MARCH 12 at 8/7c. \n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Such shelves are important because they hold back a vast amount of ice. If all such West Antarctic shelves were to collapse and spill the ice into the ocean then global sea level would rise by 10 feet. Beneath the Ross Ice Shelf is one of the least explored bits of ocean on Earth. New Zealand scientists used a hot-water drill hose to create a hole through the thick ice until they reached the perpetually dark water. They hoped to study the health and history of the shelf. Their findings surprised them. They found that the ice in the hole itself and along the base of the shelf was crystalizing and freezing rather than melting. Measurements will be taken for the next few years, to see how the Ross Ice Shelf is changing over time.\n\nRead more in \"Deep Bore Into Antarctica Finds Freezing Ice, Not Melting as Expected\"\n\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/ross-ice-shelf-bore-antarctica-freezing/\n\nDeep Bore Into Antarctica Finds Freezing Ice, Not Melting as Expected | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/fyjt5zpNAeg\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-02-22T18:00:03.000Z"},{"id":"KCTZONkzg6E","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/KCTZONkzg6E/0.jpg","title":"How Do Bathrooms Work in Space? | StarTalk","description":"Neil deGrasse Tyson and astronaut Scott Kelly discuss garbage removal, zero-g toilets, and how astronauts get their drinking water up on the International Space Station.  \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ STARTALK AIRS SUNDAYS 11/10c.\n\nAbout StarTalk:\nHost Neil deGrasse Tyson brings together celebrities, scientists and comedians to explore a variety of cosmic topics and collide pop culture with science in a way that late-night television has never seen before.

But light pollution can disorient them, causing them to crawl the wrong way—sometimes for hours. The researchers wanted to see what affect time spent crawling on land had on the hatchlings’ swimming abilities. After crawling on the treadmill, the scientists tested the turtles' level of exhaustion they swam. Even after long periods of crawling, they could still swim for a two-hour test.

Some links in that network, once unknown, have now come into view.\nWhen preyed upon, gelatinous animals, like jellyfish and comb jellies, quickly become unrecognizable, and so are undercounted in predators’ guts. Plus, jellies are hard to catch with a net. But with remote-operated vehicles, MBARI researchers have been filming ocean life—including jellies—for decades. By reviewing their footage, MBARI has changed the model of the deep-sea ecosystem. They've found that jelly-like animals play a bigger role than previously thought. Jellies served as a food source for several types of sea creatures, and also preyed upon a number of species, such as squid. The food web just got a little more tangled.\n\nREAD: See the Hidden Eating Habits of Deep-Sea Creatures\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/deep-sea-food-web-study-underwater-vehicles-video-spd/\n\nSee Secret Eating Habits of Deep-Sea Dwellers | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/vCBP25B7hAc\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-12-21T18:00:08.000Z"},{"id":"btcTfor-j-c","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/btcTfor-j-c/0.jpg","title":"What is a Solstice? | National Geographic","description":"What is the definition of a solstice, and when do they happen?

The proof is in their bones. A research team led by Alison Macintosh of the University of Cambridge compared ancient female skeletons with bones of modern women athletes, including members of this rowing team. One finding: ordinary women living around 5,000 BC had even stronger arms than the modern athletes. Previous studies compared bones of ancient women with men from the same era. That led to an underestimate for the women's muscle strength. Life in early agrarian societies included lots of upper body exercise. Grinding grain into flour took enormous effort, with an effect on the arms similar to rowing. Such clues from ancient women's bones can teach us about their labor, and their lives.\n\nWhy Prehistoric Women Had Super-Strong Bones | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/Vcbds6YgK7o\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-12-07T18:00:02.000Z"},{"id":"mw_pkGKvNwo","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/mw_pkGKvNwo/0.jpg","title":"Thousands Of Miles Dead Reckoning | StarTalk","description":"Neil deGrasse Tyson speaks with traditional Polynesian voyager Nainoa Thompson about how to navigate to far-off destinations without the use of any modern navigation tools.  \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ STARTALK AIRS SUNDAYS 11/10c.\n\nAbout StarTalk:\nHost Neil deGrasse Tyson brings together celebrities, scientists and comedians to explore a variety of cosmic topics and collide pop culture with science in a way that late-night television has never seen before.

By eating less meat, people can reduce their carbon footprint and also minimize excessive water use.\n\nBut Paul McCartney’s campaign for people to reduce their meat consumption is a deeply personal one.\n \nMcCartney, a global icon and former Beatle who is often known more for his music than his activism, is a vegetarian himself and discussed his personal choices and passions in an interview with Susan Goldberg, editor-in-chief of National Geographic magazine.\n \nIn the interview, McCartney talks about his nonprofit campaign, “Meat Free Monday.” The campaign focuses on the negative ways that eating meat can harm the environment, and McCartney hopes to encourage people to help slow the progression of climate change by eating less meat.\n \nIn the interview, McCartney also told Goldberg about his inspiration for writing the Beatles' song \"Lady Madonna\"—a National Geographic photograph of a Malayo-Polynesian woman nursing a baby. The image, taken by photographer Howard Sochurek, was published in the January 1965 issue of the magazine.\n \nTo learn more, read the full article (https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/paul-mccartney-documentary-beatles-vegetarian-meat-mondays/) and visit http://www.MeatFreeMondays.com.\n\nWhy Paul McCartney Started the \"Meat Free Monday\" Movement (Exclusive) | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/hx64I5oZ95Q\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-11-02T20:00:03.000Z"},{"id":"9t3C_ZhCUIU","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/9t3C_ZhCUIU/0.jpg","title":"Mysterious Brain-Eating Shark Killer Identified, Though Questions Remain | National Geographic","description":"A mysterious mass die-off of sea creatures in the San Francisco Bay has been solved.

Researchers with the Pelagic Shark Research Foundation tracked the stranding locations. Necropsies of the leopard sharks revealed the parasites had been entering through the sharks' noses, and eating away at their brains, causing them to become disoriented. While it’s still unclear why the parasites have affected so much sea life, weakened immune systems have increased some species’ susceptibility.

When scientists spotted a whale near the surface, they launched the drone and waited for it to breach. When it shot air from its blowhole, the drone flew through the resulting spray, collecting phlegm on its attached petri dishes. The snot samples will give scientists a non-invasive way to study the whale’s DNA.\n \nSee more from Earth LIVE: http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/earth-live/\n\nScientists Fly a Drone to Collect Whale Snot | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/UAi9H0dty6o\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-07-13T12:00:06.000Z"},{"id":"-lxFtO0kiaw","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/-lxFtO0kiaw/0.jpg","title":"Revealing the Face of a 1,600-Year-Old Mummy | National Geographic","description":"See how science and technology helped reconstruct the face of the iconic Moche mummy, the Señora de Cao.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

What drives the increase in lying sophistication is the development of a child’s ability to put himself or herself in someone else’s shoes. Known as theory of mind, this is the facility we acquire for understanding the beliefs, intentions, and knowledge of others. Also fundamental to lying is the brain’s executive function: the abilities required for planning, attention, and self-control. The two-year-olds who lied in Lee’s experiments performed better on tests of theory of mind and executive function than those who didn’t. Even at 16, kids who were proficient liars outperformed poor liars.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

National Geographic Young Explorer Mark Wong discovered the first recorded living colony while digging in the mud in Singapore. Scientists haven't been able to find another living colony. The ants' tiny mandibles reminded the entomologist that first discovered them of the stubby arms of Tyrannosaurus rex and other carnivorous dinosaurs. They live in small colonies of about 30 individuals, are likely nocturnal, and may be picky eaters.\n\nClick here to read more about the rare ants.\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/05/ants-trex-alive-rare-species-animals/\n\n'T. rex' Ant Found Alive for First Time (Rare Species) | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/AdVTRL9_GAA\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-05-18T12:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"VnQnvRhgNPI","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/VnQnvRhgNPI/0.jpg","title":"The Challenges with Cancer Trials | Breakthrough","description":"Doctors describe some of the challenges they are facing and slowly besting while fighting cancer. \n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Watch all clips of Breakthrough here: http://bit.ly/WatchBreakthrough\n➡ Get More Breakthrough: http://bit.ly/NGBreakthrough\n➡ Visit the Breakthrough DIGITAL EXPERIENCE: http://bit.ly/Breakthrough-Experience\n➡ BREAKTHROUGH AIRS TUESDAYS 10/9c.\n\nAbout Breakthrough:\nBreakthrough provides a thought-provoking and imaginative perspective on scientific discovery as it unfolds.

Female human body chemistry is different from that of males, but historically, medical testing has failed to investigate how treatment outcomes can be different based on sex. The default for pharmaceutical trials has been to use male physiology, a practice that has sometimes led to bad or even disastrous results after a drug is approved. One advantage of EVATAR is that it can simulate the entire menstrual cycle with the appropriate changes in chemistry.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

NASA scientists tried to figure out the answer after the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope recorded gamma rays, the highest-energy form of light, originating from solar flares on the far side of the sun on three separate occasions. NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft captured images of each event from the far side, allowing scientists to connect these \"beyond-the-limb\" solar flares with observations from Fermi. Studying the sun may help scientists predict solar flares, which, when aimed at Earth, can cause both beautiful auroras and communications system disruptions.\n\nRead more about the discovery in \"Our Sun Produces Bizarre Radiation Bursts—Now NASA Knows Why.\"\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/02/nasa-solar-flares-radiation-gamma-rays-fermi-space-science/\n\nVideo footage and animations courtesy NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nEarth-Orbiting Telescope Sees Far Side of Sun for the First Time | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/48_qGtI08i8\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-02-23T21:00:01.000Z"},{"id":"vm0lo3X1Qko","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/vm0lo3X1Qko/0.jpg","title":"Meet Warriors on a Mission to Help Lions and Humans Coexist | Expedition Raw","description":"Jeneria Lekilelei, a warrior from the Samburu tribe of Northern Kenya, has dedicated his life to wildlife conservation.

California's Oroville Dam holds a reservoir containing 1.1 trillion gallons of water, providing water—and power—to much of the state. Recent weather events caused it to fill up way above normal capacity. Concrete in the 50-year-old dam's main spillway, designed to handle overflow, crumbled, forcing managers to use the auxiliary or emergency spillway. Water pouring from the emergency spillway caused damage to the ground below, putting that spillway at risk of collapsing and leading to an evacuation of more than 180,000 nearby residents. The situation has since stabilized and people have been told they can return home, but workers are still rushing to make repairs and shore up the dam ahead of approaching storms.\n\nRead more about the crisis in Oroville and the state of disrepair affecting thousands of dams across the country.\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/02/oroville-dam-crisis-infrastructure-safety/\n\nFootage courtesy Cal OES, California DWR\n\nCalifornia Dam Crisis: Racing to Avoid Environmental Disaster | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/Cg-isID0u4E\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-02-16T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"GNA_1NZFtLw","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/GNA_1NZFtLw/0.jpg","title":"A Cockroach Crawled Inside a Woman's Head.

So maybe it's understandable that when a woman living near Chennai, India, complained of a pain in her nose that was keeping her from getting to sleep, the first doctor she consulted didn’t reach that correct diagnosis. He told the woman the pain should resolve on its own. Fortunately, a second physician referred her to Chennai’s Stanley Medical College and Hospital, where the ENT Department discovered the embedded insect. Using endoscopy, they succeeded in pulling the still-living roach from a sinus cavity through the nose. Dr. M.N. Shankar, head of ENT at Stanley, remarked that the procedure may have prevented a possible infection of the brain.\n\nREAD: A Horrifying List of Creatures That Can Crawl Into Your Body\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/02/roach-in-nose-ear-insects-science/\n\nA Cockroach Crawled Inside a Woman's Head.

Through photosynthesis, it’s been estimated that these single-cell algae produce up to one-quarter of the Earth’s oxygen. In addition to their important role within the ecosystem, diatoms also possess uniquely beautiful cell structures. During the Victorian era, this beauty inspired artists to position the jewel-like cells into dazzling arrangements under the lens of the microscope. This unusual art form was almost lost with time, but was recently revived by modern-day microscopist Klaus Kemp. Struck by the beauty and symmetry of diatoms, Kemp worked obsessively for 8 years to perfect his own technique. \n\nIn this short film by Matthew Killip, peer into the peculiar art of diatom arrangement and witness a modern-day diatom master at work.\n\nKlaus Kemp - http://www.diatoms.co.uk/\nMatthew Killip:http://www.matthewkillip.com/\n\nThese Kaleidoscopic Masterpieces Are Invisible to the Naked Eye | Short Film Showcase\nhttps://youtu.be/qxkbSk--EUY\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-02-09T13:00:05.000Z"},{"id":"4XP6T1CMgBQ","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/4XP6T1CMgBQ/0.jpg","title":"Aftermath of a Chimpanzee Murder Caught in Rare Video | National Geographic","description":"It was a grisly sight: a murdered chimpanzee, his body beaten, bloodied—and partially cannibalized—by the community he used to lead.

The animal it belonged to would have lived about 99 million years ago. Researchers from China and Canada identify it as a juvenile of some type of coelurosaur, a group that includes birdlike dinosaur species that walked on two legs. But because the bones of the tail are flexible and not fused as in a bird’s tail, the specimen must be a terrestrial dinosaur rather than an actual bird. Lida Xing, first author of the study announcing the discovery, found the amber for sale in a northern Myanmar (Burma) market.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Scientists at Humboldt University of Berlin are studying rats to try and solve the longstanding mystery. Given the right conditions, and enough back and belly tickling by a researcher, ratscan come to associate a researcher's cotton gloved hand with the sensation of being tickled. Tickling makes them “giggle,” albeit in frequencies too high for human ears to hear. The rats develop a fondness for the human hands, chasing their scurrying fingers in circles. The scientists observe the rat ticklishness, and track how their brain processes the sensation, hoping to uncover clues about the laugh-inducing feeling. \n\nREAD: What Happens When Scientists Tickle a Rat\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/11/rats-tickling-brains-moods/\n\nSee What Happens When You Tickle a Rat | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/d-84UJpYFRM\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-12-01T16:00:03.000Z"},{"id":"qZdnViYza2o","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/qZdnViYza2o/0.jpg","title":"Politics of Climate Change | Years of Living Dangerously","description":"Bradley Whitford talks to Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse about what makes climate change a partisan issue.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Watch all clips of Years of Living Dangerously here: http://bit.ly/WatchYearsofLivingDangerously\n➡ Get More Years of Living Dangerously: http://bit.ly/NGYearsofLivingDangerously\n\nAbout Years of Living Dangerously:\nIn this groundbreaking event series, celebrity correspondents bring us stories on those affected by, and seeking solutions to, climate change - from locations shockingly close to home.

Animal behavior researcher Lars Chittka and colleagues used a method commonly applied to birds and mammals. Food, in this case sugar water, is available to an animal—if it can get at it. Through increasingly challenging setups, selected bumblebees eventually developed the consistent practice of pulling a string to get at the prize. But once one bee was trained, others could then learn just by watching and interacting with a more experienced peer.\n\nRead \"How Bees Teach Each Other to Solve Problems\" from National Geographic News.\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/bees-learn-by-watching-each-other-bumblebees/\n\nHow to Train a Bumblebee: Scientists Study Insect Intelligence | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/D-vScQmBbs4\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2016-11-17T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"xKsi3i4zTfs","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/xKsi3i4zTfs/0.jpg","title":"What's in Dry-Erase Markers? | Ingredients With George Zaidan (Episode 10)","description":"Dry-erase markers have no ingredient list!

Archeologist and 2016 National Geographic emerging explorer Yukinori Kawae is trying to figure this out. As a young boy Kawae was fascinated by the Egyptian pyramids, and with his parent's permission moved to Egypt after high school because he wanted to see the pyramids in person. Now Kawae is heading up an interdisciplinary approach to studying the pyramids, collaborating with computer scientists and mathematicians to collect 3-D data that will provide a new perspective of the stunning structures—with the hope of learning more about the people who built them, how they built them, and why.\n \nUpcoming Events at National Geographic Live\nhttp://events.nationalgeographic.com/events/\n \nPRODUCER: Hilary Hudson\nEDITOR: Adam Lee\nTECHNICAL DIRECTOR: John McDonald\nSERIES PRODUCER: Chris Mattle\n \nThe National Geographic Live series brings thought-provoking presentations by today’s leading explorers, scientists, photographers, and performing artists right to you.
