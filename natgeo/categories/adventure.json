Its mix of modern and historic architecture is what makes the city unique. Fernando G. Baptista has worked as a graphics editor and artist at National Geographic for more than 10 years. But his roots are in Bilbao, where he was born and first tried his hand at infographics. In this video, he gives a behind-the-scenes look at how he created a model of himself painting his hometown and tells us why it's a place he loves. \n\nRead more about Bilbao in the June/July issue of National Geographic Traveler magazine.\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/europe/spain/bilbao-things-to-do-fernando-baptista\n\nAn Artist's Portrait of His Spanish Hometown Bilbao | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/OmTkrTUazqY\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2018-06-02T17:00:02.000Z"},{"id":"RApj7vNUYaM","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/RApj7vNUYaM/0.jpg","title":"The Incredible Sport of Mounted Archery | National Geographic","description":"The ancient sport of mounted archery is undergoing a resurgence in Indonesia as both men and women take up the sport.\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Despite increasing crowds, until now Horseshoe Bend has had minimal development. 2018 is seeing the addition of a viewing platform with a guardrail, and an accessible trail. Local planners aim to limit the project’s effect on the land. But human impact on the region’s landmarks is a contentious subject. Nearby Glen Canyon Dam which created the vast reservoir of Lake Powell is still controversial decades after construction.\n\nA little southeast of the dam, Antelope Canyon’s two segments lie on Navajo land. They’re considered the most-photographed of the slot canyon landscapes in the Southwest. Colors in the sinuous channels change as light shifts. Generally dry, the riverbeds face the risk of flash floods when rains hit. But such forces also carved the sandstone’s flowing shapes.\n\nRead more in \"Road Trip to the Underrated Side of the Grand Canyon\"\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/arizona/grand-canyon/north-rim-road-trip-grand-canyon-national-park/\n\nhttp://travel.nationalgeographic.com/photographer-of-the-year-2018/\nEnter the Travel Photographer of the Year Contest.

And the roots of its former residents may extend to ancient times. This region, Calabria, is the toe at the tip of Italy's boot. And when the Greeks started colonizing the area in the eighth century BC, Calabria was a toehold. Over the centuries, southern Italy again received Hellenic immigrants, displaced from the eastern Mediterranean. Newcomers either revived a flagging Greek-speaking minority, or reintroduced a language that had died out locally. Incredibly, even today there are a few thousand Greek speakers in Calabria. One village where you might hear the local dialect of Greko, or Italian Greek, is Roghudi Nuovo—New Roghudi—part of a cluster of Ionian seacoast towns on the outskirts of the city of Reggio. Today’s Roghudi was founded by people from Old Roghudi—Roghudi Vecchio, when floods forced virtually everyone out. \n\nRead more in  \"Tour an Abandoned Village in the Hills of Southern Italy\"\nhttps://on.natgeo.com/2rxCy13\n\nhttp://travel.nationalgeographic.com/photographer-of-the-year-2018/\nEnter the Travel Photographer of the Year Contest.

But by 1960, the few who remained were forced out by the construction of a large reservoir. In the fall, the water levels in the artificial lake drop every year, allowing a view of at least the tops of the buildings from the old town. Last year's low water levels revealed more parts of the town, and this year's worsening drought has all but dried out the valley. The only remaining water is that of the original riverbed. For a few former inhabitants, it's a chance to revisit what remains of their old hometown—a happy side effect amid a catastrophic drought. \n\nRead \"Ruins of Spanish Town Emerge After Decades Underwater\": https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/spain-town-mansilla-de-la-sierra-reservoir-drought-spd/\n\nTown Drowned By Dam Returns From the Dead | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/stTlIs_JKBY\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-11-04T17:00:08.000Z"},{"id":"v3zcL3bOiuM","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/v3zcL3bOiuM/0.jpg","title":"Watch This Guy Balance Rocks on Water in the Most Mesmerizing Way | Short Film Showcase","description":"Watch stone artist Manu Topic's balancing act in the French Pyrenees’ L’Arros river.

Those suspected of siding with Stalin could end up at Goli Otok, where prisoners tortured one another when they weren't performing forced hard labor in a quarry.

With no trail to follow, the two found themselves bushwhacking through dense brush and cacti, and moving up and down steep vertical terrain in scorching heat as they navigated their way through the canyon. Though they initially embarked on the hike as a way to raise public awareness of development issues threatening the iconic national park, the pair quickly found they had completely underestimated the difficulty of their journey and nearly quit in the first week.

He began rousing other natural resource activists and outdoor enthusiasts in 1930, when his piece, “The Problem of the Wilderness,” was published in Scientific Monthly. Committed to protecting the nation’s wildlands, Marshall gathered these spirited individuals and founded The Wilderness Society in 1935. Still active today, the organization fights to preserve “that extremely minor fraction of outdoor America which yet remains free from mechanical sights and sounds and smell.” \n\nWith Bob Marshall’s poetic words as your guide, immerse yourself in the beauty of the Alaskan wilderness with this stunning short film by filmmaker Tom Welsh. \n\nFollow Tom Welsh:\nhttp://getdeluxe.co/\nhttp://vimeo.com/getdeluxe\nhttp://instagram.com/getdeluxe\n\nLose Yourself in the Exquisite Beauty of the Alaskan Wilderness | Short Film Showcase\nhttps://youtu.be/Y9D0WJPZLoE\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-02-18T18:00:04.000Z"},{"id":"HyNyTspJta4","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/HyNyTspJta4/0.jpg","title":"360° Wingwalker - Part 2 | National Geographic","description":"The wild ride in the sky continues as wingwalker CAROL PILON \n@CarolPilonWingwalker shows you what it’s like to hang onto the wings of a vintage biplane at 160mph.\n\nTo check out 360° WINGWALKER - PART 1 follow this link: \n[INCLUDE CROSSLINK URL TO “WINGWALKER - PART 1” POST IN CAPTION HERE]\n➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

As a young girl growing up in her rural village, Mira endured a harsh life of poverty and hardship. At age 14, she ran away from home to join the Maoist rebel fighters in the jungle. Thanks to a chance encounter several years later, Mira eventually discovered the sport of ultrarunning and was quickly recognized as a prodigy. Without food, water, or proper equipment,Mira ran through hail and rain for more than 31 miles to win her first race.\n\nShaped by the tough demands of her life in the mountains, Mira’s natural ability is propelling her to become one of the best ultrarunners in the world today. As she continues following her dream,Mira also works to empower other women in Nepal through sports. \n\nIn this short film by Lloyd Belcher, follow Mira's journey from village girl to ultrarunning superstar. \n\nRead more about  2017 National Geographic Adventurer of the Year Mira Rai: http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/adventurers-of-the-year/2017/mira-rai-peoples-choice-adventurer-of-the-year\n\nWatch the full-length documentary: \nhttps://vimeo.com/ondemand/miraraifilm/160595883\nhttp://www.miraraifilm.com/\n\nFollow Lloyd Belcher:\nhttp://www.lloydbelchervisuals.com/\n\nHow This Former Child Soldier Became an Ultrarunning Prodigy | Short Film Showcase\nhttps://youtu.be/ibZyGtK1_v8\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo","date":"2017-01-28T16:00:05.000Z"},{"id":"5DuNlUhpOEY","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/5DuNlUhpOEY/0.jpg","title":"Epic Grand Canyon Hike: Frozen Shoes and Low on Food (Part 2) | National Geographic","description":"➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n➡ Watch Part 3: https://youtu.be/ko_uNRJAzwE\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.
